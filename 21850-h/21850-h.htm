My cabin cowers in the pathless sweep</p>

Of the terrible northern blast;</p>

HER ADOPTIVE PARENTS.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
&#34;Ans, the next time you twist hay f'r the fire, I wish't you'd
dodge the damp spots,&#34; said the cook, rising from a prolonged
scrutiny of the stove and the bread in the oven. His pose was threatening.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Cooks are always grumblin',&#34; calmly remarked Anson, drawing 
on his gloves preparatory to going out to the barn; &#34;but seein' 's 
this is Chris'mus, I'll go out an' knock a barrel to pieces. I want 
them biscuit to be O.&nbsp;K. See?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes: I see.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say, Bert!&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well?&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_002" id="Page_002">2</a></span>
&#34;Can't we have some sugar-'lasses on our biscuits, seein' it's Chris'mus?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, I s'pose we can, Ans; but we're gittin' purty low on the thing
 these days, an' they ain't no tellin' when we'll be able to git more.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, jes' as you say, not as I care.&#34; Anson went out into the
roaring wind with a shout of defiance, but came back instantly, as if to
say something he had forgotten. &#34;Say, wha' d'ye s'pose is the trouble
over to the Norsk's? I hain't seen a sign o' smoke over there f'r two 'r
three days.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, now you speak of it, Ans, I've be'n thinkin' about that myself. 
I'm afraid he's out o' coal, 'r sick, 'r somethin'. It 'u'd be mighty tough 
f'r the woman an' babe to be there without any fire, an' this blizzard
whoopin' her up. I guess you'd better go over an' see what's up. I was
goin' to speak of it this mornin', but f'rgot it. I'm cook this week, 
so I guess the job falls on you.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;All right. Here goes.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Better take a horse.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_003" id="Page_003">3</a></span>
&#34;No: I guess not. The snow is driftin' purty bad, an' he couldn't git
through the drifts, anyway.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, lookout f'r y'rself, ol' man. It looks purty owly off in the
west. Don't waste any time. I'd hate like thunder to be left alone on a
Dakota prairie f'r the rest o' the winter.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Anson laughed back through the mist of snow that blew in the open door,
his great-coat and cap allowing only a glimpse of his cheeks.
</p>
<p>
The sky was bright overhead, but low down around the horizon it looked
wild. The air was frightfully cold&mdash;far below zero&mdash;and the
wind had been blowing almost every day for a week, and was still strong.
The snow was sliding fitfully along the sod with a stealthy, menacing 
motion, and far off in the west and north a dense, shining cloud of
frost was hanging.
</p>
<p>
The plain was almost as lone and level and bare as a polar ocean, where
death and silence reign undisputedly. There was not a tree in sight, the
grass was mainly 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_004" id="Page_004">4</a></span>
burned, or buried by the snow, and the little shanties of the three
or four settlers could hardly be said to be in sight, half sunk, as
they were, in drifts. A large white owl seated on a section stake
was the only living thing to be seen.
</p>
<p>
The boom had not yet struck Buster County. Indeed, it did not seem to
Bert Gearheart at this moment that it would ever strike Buster County. 
It was as cold, dreary, and unprofitable an outlook as a man could face
and not go utterly mad. If any of these pioneers could have forecast
 the winter, they would not have dared to pass it on the plains.
</p>
<p>
Bert watched his partner as he strode rapidly across the prairie, now
lost to sight as a racing troop of snow-waves, running shoulder-high,
shot between, now reappearing as the wind lulled.
</p>
<p>
&#34;This is gittin' pretty monotonous, to tell the honest truth,&#34; 
he muttered as he turned from the little window. &#34;If that railroad
don't show up by March, in some shape or other, I'm goin' to give it up. 
Gittin' free land like this is a little too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_005" id="Page_005">5</a></span>
costly for me. I'll go back to Wiscons', an' rent land on shares.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Bert was a younger-looking man than his bachelor companion; perhaps
because his face was clean-shaven and his frame much slighter. He was
a silent, moody young fellow, hard to get along with, though of great
good heart. Anson Wood succeeded in winning and holding his love even
through the trials of masculine housekeeping. As Bert kept on with the
dinner, he went often to the little window facing the east and looked
out, each time thawing a hole in the frost on the window-panes.
</p>
<p>
The wind was rising again, and the night promised to be wild, as the two
preceding nights had been. As he moved back and forth setting out their
scanty meal, he was thinking of the old life back in Wisconsin in the
deeps of the little <i>coul&#233;e</i>; of the sleigh-rides with the
boys and girls; of the Christmas doings; of the damp, thick-falling
snow among the pines, where the wind had no terrors; of musical bells on 
swift horses in the fragrant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_006" id="Page_006">6</a></span>
deeps, where the snowflakes fell like caresses through the tossing
branches of the trees.
</p>
<p>
By the side of such a life the plain, with its sliding snow and
ferocious wind, was appalling&mdash;a treeless expanse and a
racing-ground for snow and wind. The man's mood grew darker while
he mused. He served the meal on the rude box which took the place
of table, and still his companion did not come. He looked at his 
watch. It was nearly one o'clock, and yet there was no sign of the
sturdy figure of Anson.
</p>
<p>
The house of the poor Norwegian was about two miles away, and out of
sight, being built in a gully; but now the eye could distinguish a
house only when less than a mile away. A man could not at times be
seen at a distance of ten rods, though occasional lulls in the wind
permitted Bert to see nearly to the &#34;First Moccasin.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;He may be in the swale,&#34; muttered the watcher as he stood
with his eye to the loop-hole. But the next time he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_007" id="Page_007">7</a></span>
looked the plain was as wild and lone as before, save under the 
rising blast the snow was beginning to ramp and race across the
level sod till it looked at times like a sea running white with
foam and misty with spray.
</p>
<p>
At two o'clock he said: &#34;Well, I s'pose Ans has concluded to
stay over there to dinner, though what the Norsk can offer as
inducement I swear I don't know. I'll eat, anyhow; he can have
what's left.&#34;
</p>
<p>
He sat down to his lonely meal, and ate slowly, getting up two or
three times from his candle-box in a growing anxiety for Ans,
using the heated poker now to clear a spot on the pane. He
expressed his growing apprehension, manlike, by getting angry.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I don't see what the darn fool means by stayin' so late.
It'll be dark by four o'clock, er jest as soon as that cloud
over there strikes us. You couldn't beat sense into some men's
heads with a club.&#34;
</p>
<p>
He had eaten his dinner now, and had taken to pacing up and down the
little room, which was exactly six paces long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_008" id="Page_008">8</a></span>
and three wide, and just high enough to permit Anson to walk erect
in the highest part.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Nice fix to leave a man in, ain't it? All alone here, an' a blizzard
comin' on! If I ever git out o' this country alive, I'll bet I'll know
enough not to come back,&#34; he broke out, stamping his foot in a rage.
&#34;I don't see what he means by it. If he's caught in that blow,
his life ain't worth a cent.&#34;

</div>
<p class="head">
HER FIRST TRIP IN A BLIZZARD.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
At half-past two the feelings of the silent watcher began to change.
He thought more about his partner out there in the rising wind and
thickening snow. The blast roared round the little cabin with a deep,
menacing, rising moan, and laid to the stove-pipe a resounding lip,
wailing and shouting weirdly. Bert's nervous walk quickened, and he
looked so often through the pane that the frost had not time to close up.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, out of the blinding, sweeping snow, not ten rods distant,
the burly form of Anson burst, head down, blindly staggering forward
into the teeth of the tempest. He walked like a man whose strength was
almost gone, and he carried a large bundle in his arms.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_010" id="Page_010">10</a></span>
Gearhart flung the door open, and called in a cheery voice to guide
the struggling man to the house. He knew what it was to face such a wind.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Here ye are, ol' man! Right this way! Keep y'r head down!&#34;
</p>
<p>
Then, seeing that Anson hardly made headway against the terrible blast,
he rushed out, bare-headed as he was, and caught and hurried him in and
shut the door.
</p>
<p>
Reeling blindly, his breath roaring like a furnace, his eyebrows hung with
icicles, his face masked with crusted snow, Anson staggered in, crying
hoarsely, &#34;Take her!&#34; then slid to the floor, where he lay panting
for breath.
</p>
<p>
Bert caught the bundle from his arms. A wailing, half-smothered cry 
came from it.
</p>
<p>
&#34;What is it, Ans?&#34; he asked.
</p>
<p>
&#34;A kid; warm it,&#34; said the giant, trying with his numbed fingers
to undo the shawl which wrapped the bundle. Bert hurriedly unwound the
shawl, and a frightened child, blue-eyed and flaxen-haired&mdash;flossy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_011" id="Page_011">11</a></span>
as unfrosted corn-silk&mdash;was disclosed like a nubbin of corn
after the husks are stripped off.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Why, it's little Flaxen Hair! Wha' d'ye bring her over for?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;'Sh!&#34; said Anson hoarsely. &#34;Mind how y' git her warm!
Don't y' see she's froze?&#34;
</p>
<p>
The little creature was about five, or possibly six years old,
scantily clad, but neat and pretty. As her feet began to get warm before
the fire, she wailed with pain, which Bert tried to stop by rubbing.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Put her hands in y'r hair, hold her feet in y'r hands&mdash;don't
rub 'em,&#34; commanded Ans, who was stripping the ice from his eyelashes
and from his matted beard, which lay like a shield upon his breast. 
&#34;Stir up the fire; give her some hot coffee an' some feed. She
hain't had anything to eat.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Bert tried to do all these things at once, and could not, but managed
finally to get the child a piece of bread and a cup of coffee, and to
allay her fears. Ans began 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">12</a></span>
to recover from his horrible journey and was able to speak, though his
lungs were still painful.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Ol' man,&#34; he said solemnly and tenderly, &#34;I came jest as
near stayin' in that last gully down there as a man could an' not. The
snow was up to my armpits, an' let me down wherever the weeds was. I
had to waller; if it hadn't be'n for her, I guess I'd 'a' give up; 
but I jest grit m' teeth an' pulled through. There, guess y' hadn't
better let her have any more. I guess she'll go to sleep now she's fed
an' warmed. Jest le' me take her now, ol' man.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;No: you git rested up.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;See here, it'll rest me to hold that little chap. I'm all right.
My hands is frosted some, an' my ears, that's all, but my breath is 
gittin' back. Come on, now,&#34; he pleaded.
</p>
<p>
Bert surrendered the child, who looked up into the bearded face of the
rough fellow, then rested her head on his breast, and went to sleep at
last. It made his heart thrill as he felt her little head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_013" id="Page_013">13</a></span>
against his breast. He never had held a child in his arms before.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say, Bert, reckon I'm a purty fair picture of a fam'ly man, now,
eh? Throw in a couple o' twists more o' hay&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
Bert stirred up the fire.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, now the little one is off, what's up over to the Norsk's? 
Wha' d'ye bring the child for?&#34; he asked at last.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Because she was the only livin' soul in the shanty.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;What?&#34; His face was set in horror.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Fact.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Where's the Norsk?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I don't know. On the prairie somewhere.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;An' the mother?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;She's&mdash;&#34; Here the little one stirred slightly as he
leaned forward, and Ans said, with a wink, &#34;She's <em>asleep</em>.&#34; 
He winked significantly, and Bert understood what the sleep was. 
&#34;Be a little careful what y' say&mdash;jes' now; the little rat is
listenin'. Jest say <em>relative</em> when y' mean her&mdash;the woman,
y' know.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; he resumed after a moment; 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_014" id="Page_014">14</a></span>
&#34;I was scart when I saw that house&mdash;when I knocked, an' no one
stirred 'r come to the door. They wasn't a track around, an' the barn
an' house was all drifted up. I pushed the door open; it was cold as a
barn, an' dark. I couldn't see anythin' f'r a minute, but I heard a
sound o' cryin' from the bed that made my hair stand up. I rushed over
there, an' there lay the mother on the bed, with nothin' on but some
kind of a night-dress, an' everythin'&mdash;dress, shawl, an'
all&mdash;piled on an' around that blessed child.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;She was sleepin'?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Like a stone. I couldn't believe it at first. I raved around
there, split up a chair an' the shelves, an' made a fire. Then I
started to rub the woman's hands an' feet, but she was cold an' hard
as iron.&#34; Bert shuddered in sympathy. &#34;Then I took the child
up an' rubbed her; tried to find somethin' f'r her to eat&mdash;not
a blessed thing in that house! Finally I thought I better bolt
f'r home&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Lucky you did. Hear that wind! 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_015" id="Page_015">15</a></span>
Great heavens! We are in for another two-days' blow of it. That woman,
of course, stripped herself to save the child.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes: she did.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Jes' like a woman! Why didn't she rip down the shelf an' split
up the chairs for fuel, or keep walkin' up an' down the room?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Now, there it is! She <em>had</em> burnt up a lot o' stuff,
then took to bed with the child. She rolled her up in all the
quilts an' shawls an' dresses they was in the house; then laid
down by the side of her, an' put her arm over her&mdash;an'
froze&mdash;jes' like a mother&mdash;no judgment!&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, lay her down now, an' eat somethin' y'rself, while I go
out an' look after the chores. Lord! it makes me crawl to think of
that woman layin' there in the shanty all alone!&#34; he turned and
said in a peculiar hesitating voice. He shivered a little as he spoke.
&#34;Say, did y' shut the door?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes: an' it shuts hard. The wind n'r wolves can't open it.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;That's good. I couldn't sleep nights 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_016" id="Page_016">16</a></span>
if I thought the coyotes could get in.&#34; Bert's imagination seized
upon that lonely cabin and the figure lying cold as iron upon the
bed. It appealed to him more than to Anson.
</p>
<p>
By four o'clock it was dark, and the lamp was lighted when Bert came
in, bringing an immense load of hay-twists. The ferocious wind, as if
exulting in its undisputed sway over the plain, raved in ceaseless
fury around the cabin, and lashed the roof with a thousand stinging
streams of snow. The tiny shanty did not rock; it shuddered as if
with fright. The drifts rose higher on the windows, and here and there
through some unseen crevice the snow, fine as bolted flour, found its
way like oil, seeming to penetrate the solid boards; and to the
stove-pipe the storm still laid hoarse lip, piping incessantly,
now dolorously, now savagely, now high, now low.
</p>
<p>
While the two men sat above the fire that night, discussing the sad case
of the woman, the child slept heavily, muttering and sobbing in her sleep.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017">17</a></span>
&#34;The probabilities are,&#34; said Anson, in a matter-of-fact way, 
&#34;the Norsk took his oxen an' started f'r Summit f'r provisions, 
an' got caught in this blizzard an' froze to death
 somewhere&mdash;got lost in some gully, probably.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;But why didn't he come an' tell us to look after his fam'ly?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, I s'pose he was afraid to trust us. I don't wonder,
as I remember the treatment their women git from the Yankees. 
We look a good 'eal worse than we are, besides; an' then the 
poor cuss couldn't talk to us, anyhow, an' he's be'n shy ever
since he came, in October.&#34;
</p>
<p>
After a long silence, in which Gearheart went over and studied
the face of the sleeper, Anson said: &#34;Well, if he's dead,
an' the woman's dead too, we've got to look after this child
till some relative turns up. An' that woman's got to be buried.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;All right. What's got to be done had better be done right off.
We've only one bed, Ans, an' a cradle hasn't appeared necessary
before. How about the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018">18</a></span>
sleepin' to-night? If you're goin' into the orphan-asylum business,
you'll have to open up correspondence with a furniture store.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Ans reddened a little. &#34;It ain't mine any more'n yours. 
We're pardners in this job.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;No: I guess not. You look more like a dad, an' I guess I'll shift
the responsibility of this thing off onto you. I'll bunk here on the
floor, an' you take the child an' occupy the bed.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, all right,&#34; answered Anson, going over in his turn and
looking down at the white face and tow-coloured hair of the little
stranger. &#34;But say, we ain't got no night-clothes f'r the little
chap. What'll we do? Put her to sleep jes' as she is?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I reckon we'll have to to-night. Maybe you'll find some more
clothes over to the shanty.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say, Bert,&#34; said Ans later.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;It's too darn cold f'r you to sleep on the floor there. 
You git in here on the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019">19</a></span>
back side, an' I'll take the child on the front. She'd be smashed
flatter'n a pancake if she was in the middle. She ain't bigger'n 
a pint o' cider, anyway.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;No, ol' man. I'll lay here on the floor, an' kind o' heave a
twist in once in a while. It's goin' to be cold enough to freeze
the tail off a brass bull by daylight.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Ans bashfully crept in beside the sleeping child, taking care not to
waken her, and lay there thinking of his new responsibility. At every
shiver of the cowering cabin and rising shriek of the wind, his heart 
went out in love toward the helpless little creature whose dead mother
lay in the cold and deserted shanty, and whose father was wandering
perhaps breathless and despairing on the plain, or lying buried in the
snow in some deep ravine beside his patient oxen. He tucked the clothing
in carefully about the child, felt to see if her little feet were cold,
and covered her head with her shawl, patting her lightly with his great paw.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_020" id="Page_020">20</a></span>
&#34;Say, Bert!&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, Ans, what now?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;If this little chap should wake up an' cry f'r its mother, what
in thunder would I do?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Give it up, ol' boy,&#34; was the reply from the depths of the
buffalo-robes before the fire. &#34;Pat her on the back, an' tell
her not to cry, or somethin' like that.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;But she can't tell what I say.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, she'll understand if y' kind o' chuckle an' gurgle like a
fam'ly man.&#34; But the little one slept on, and when, about midnight, 
Bert got up to feed the fire, he left the stove door open to give light, 
and went softly over to the sleepers. Ans was sleeping with the little
form close to his breast, and the poor, troubled face safe under his 
shaggy beard.
</p>
<hr class="break" />
<p>
And all night long the blasting wind, sweeping the sea of icy sands, 
hissed and howled round the little sod cabin like surf beating on a
half-sunken rock. The wind and the snow and the darkness possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_021" id="Page_021">21</a></span>
the plain; and Cold (whose other name is Death) was king of the
horrible carnival. It seemed as though morning and sunlight could
not come again, so absolute was the sway of night and death.

<h2><a href="#contents">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="head">
THE BURIAL OF HER DEAD MOTHER.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
When Anson woke the next morning, he found the great flower-like eyes
of the little waif staring straight into his face with a surprise too
great for words or cries. She stared steadily and solemnly into his open
eyes for a while, and when he smiled she smiled back; but when he lifted
his large hand and tried to brush her hair she grew frightened, pushing
her little fists against him, and began to cry &#34;Mor! Mor Kom!&#34;
</p>
<p>
This roused Gearheart, who said:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, Ans, what are y' goin' to do with that child? This is your
mornin' to git breakfast. Come, roll out. I've got the fire goin' good. 
I can't let y' off; it'll break up our system.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Anson rolled out of the bunk and 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023">23</a></span>
dressed hurriedly in the cold room. The only sound was the roar of
the stove devouring the hay-twist. Anson danced about.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Thunder an' black cats, ain't it cold! The wind has died down,
or we'd be froze stiffer'n a wedge. It was mighty good in you, ol'
man, to keep the stove goin' durin' the night. The child has opened
her eyes brighter'n a dollar, but I tell you I don't like to let her
know what's happened to her relatives.&#34;
</p>
<p>
The little one began to wail in a frightened way, being alone in the
dim corner.
</p>
<p>
&#34;There she goes now; she's wantin' to go home! That's what she's
askin', jes' like's not. Say, Bert, what the devil can I do?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Talk to her, Ans; chuckle to her.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Talk! She'll think I'm threatenin' to knock her head off, or
somethin'. There there, don't ee cry! We'll go see papa
soon.&mdash;Confound it, man, I can't go on with this thing!
There, there! See, child, we're goin' to have some nice hot
pancakes now; goin' to have breakfast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024">24</a></span>
now. See, ol' pap's goin' to fry some pancakes. Whoop&mdash;see!&#34;
He took down the saucepan, and flourished it in order to make his
meaning plainer. Bert laughed.
</p>
<p>
&#34;That's as bad as your fist. Put that down, Ans. You'll scare the
young one into a fit; you ain't built f'r a jumpin'-jack.&#34;
</p>
<p>
The child did indeed set up a louder and more distracting yell.
Getting desperate, Anson seized her in his arms, and, despite her
struggles, began tossing her on his shoulder. The child understood
him and ceased to cry, especially as Gearheart began to set the
table, making a pleasant clatter, whistling the while.
</p>
<p>
The glorious light of the morning made its way only dimly through
the thickly frosted window-panes; the boards snapped in the horrible
cold; out in the barn the cattle were bellowing and kicking with pain.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Do you know,&#34; said Bert, impressively, &#34;I couldn't keep
that woman out o' my mind. I could see her layin' there without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_025" id="Page_025">25</a></span>
any quilts on her, an' the mice a-runnin' over her. God! it's tough,
this bein' alone on a prairie on such a night.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I knew I'd feel so, an' I jest naturally covered her up an' tucked
the covers in, the child a-lookin' on. I thought she'd feel better,
seein' her ma tucked in good an' warm. Poor little rat!&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Did you do that, ol' man?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;You bet I did! I couldn't have slep' a wink if I hadn't.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, why didn't y' tell me, so't <em>I</em> could sleep?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I didn't think you'd think of it that way, not havin' seen her.&#34;
</p>
<p>
The child now consented to sit in one of the chairs and put her feet
down by the stove. She wept silently now, with that infrequent, 
indrawn sob, more touching than wails. She felt that these strangers
were her friends, but she wanted her mother. She ate well, and soon
grew more resigned. She looked first at one and then at the other of
the men as they talked, trying to understand their strange language.
Then she fell to watching 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_026" id="Page_026">26</a></span>
a mouse that stole out from behind the flour-barrels, snatching a crumb
occasionally and darting back, and laughed gleefully once, and clapped
her hands.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Now, the first thing after the chores, Ans, is that woman over
there. Of course it's out o' the question buryin' her, but we'd better
go over an' git what things there is left o' the girl's, an' fasten up
the shanty to keep the wolves out.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;But then&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;What?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;The mice. You can't shut them out.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;That's so. I never thought o' that. We've got to make a box, I
guess; but it's goin' to be an awful job for me, Ans, to git her
into it. I thought I wouldn't have to touch her.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Le' me go; I've seen her once an' you hain't. I'd just as soon.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Heaven an' earth! what could I do with the babe? She'd howl like
a coyote, an' drive me plumb wild. No: you're elected to take care o'
the child. I ain't worth a picayune at it. Besides, you had your share
yesterday.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_027" id="Page_027">27</a></span>
And so, in the brilliant sunshine of that bitterly cold morning, 
Gearheart crunched away over the spotless snow, which burned under
his feet&mdash;a land mocking, glorious, pitiless. Far off some
slender columns of smoke told of two or three hearth-fires, but
mainly the plain was level and lifeless as the Polar Ocean, 
appallingly silent, no cry or stir in the whole expanse, no tree
to creak nor bell to ring.
</p>
<p>
It required strong effort on the part of the young man to open the
door of the cottage, and he stood for some time with his hand on the
latch, looking about. There was perfect silence without and within,
no trace of feet or hands anywhere. All was as peaceful and unbroken
as a sepulchre.
</p>
<p>
Finally, as if angry with himself, Gearheart shook himself and pushed
open the door, letting the morning sun stream in. It lighted the bare
little room and fell on the frozen face and rigid, half-open eyes of
the dead woman with a strong, white glare. The thin face and worn,
large-jointed hands lying outside the quilt told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_028" id="Page_028">28</a></span>
of the hardships which had been the lot of the sleeper. Her clothing
was clean and finer than one would expect to see.
</p>
<p>
Gearheart stood looking at her for a long time, the door still open,
for he felt re-enforced in some way by the sun. If any one had come
suddenly and closed the door on him and the white figure there, he
would have cried out and struggled like a madman to escape, such was
his unreasoning fear of the dead.
</p>
<p>
At length, with a long breath, he backed out and closed the door. Going
to the barn, he found a cow standing at an empty manger, and some hens
and pigs frozen in the hay. Looking about for some boards to make a coffin, 
he came upon a long box in which a reaper had been packed, and this he
proceeded to nail together firmly, and to line with pieces of an old
stove-pipe at such places as he thought the mice would try to enter.
</p>
<p>
When it was all prepared, he carried the box to the house and managed
to lay it down beside the bed; but he could not bring himself to
touch the body. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_029" id="Page_029">29</a></span>
went out to see if some one were not coming. The sound of a human
voice would have relieved him at once, and he could have gone on
without hesitation. But there was no one in sight, and no one was
likely to be; so he returned, and summoning all his resolution,
took one of the quilts from the bed and placed it in the bottom of
the box. Then he removed the pillow from beneath the head of the
dead woman and placed that in the box. Then he paused, the cold
moisture breaking out on his face.
</p>
<p>
Like all young persons born far from war, and having no knowledge of
death even in its quiet forms, he had the most powerful organic
repugnance toward a corpse. He kept his eye on it as though it were
a sleeping horror, likely at a sudden sound to rise and walk. More
than this, there had always been something peculiarly sacred in the
form of a woman, and in his calmer moments the dead mother appealed
to him with irresistible power.
</p>
<p>
At last, with a sort of moan through 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_030" id="Page_030">30</a></span>
his set teeth, he approached the bed and threw the sheet over
the figure, holding it as in a sling; then, by a mighty effort,
he swung it stiffly off the bed into the box.
</p>
<p>
He trembled so that he could hardly spread the remaining quilts
over the dead face. The box was wide enough to receive the stiff,
curved right arm, and he had nothing to do but to nail the cover on,
which he did in feverish haste. Then he rose, grasped his tools,
rushed outside, slammed the door, and set off in great speed across
the snow, pushed on by an indescribable horror.
</p>
<p>
As he neared home, his fresh young blood asserted itself more and
more; but when he entered the cabin he was still trembling, and
dropped into a chair like a man out of breath. At sight of the
ruddy face of Anson, and with the aid of the heat and light of
the familiar little room, he shook off part of his horror.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Gi' me a cup o' coffee, Ans. I'm kind o' chilly an' tired.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Before drinking he wiped his face and 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_031" id="Page_031">31</a></span>
washed his hands again and again at the basin in the corner, as though
there were something on them which was ineffably unclean. The little
one, who had been weeping again, stared at him with two big tears
drying on her hollow cheeks.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well?&#34; interrogated Anson.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I nailed her up safe enough for the present. But what're we
goin' to do next?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I can't see 's we can do anythin' as long as such weather as
this lasts. It ain't safe f'r one of us to go out an' leave the
other alone. Besides, it's thirty below zero, an' no road, Moccasin's
full of snow, an' another wind likely to rise at any time. It's
mighty tough on this little one, but it can't be helped. As soon
as it moderates a little, we'll try to find a woman an' a preacher,
an' bury that&mdash;relative.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;The only woman I know of is ol' Mrs. Cap Burdon, down on the
Third Moccasin, full fifteen miles away.&#34;

FLAXEN ADOPTS ANSON AS &#34;PAP.&#34;
</p>
<p class="noindent">
For nearly two weeks they waited, while the wind alternately raved and
whispered over them as it scurried the snow south or east, or shifted
to the south in the night, bringing &#34;the north end of a south
wind,&#34; the most intolerable and cutting of winds. Day after day
the restless snow sifted or leaped across the waste of glittering
crust; day after day the sun shone in dazzling splendor, but so
white and cold that the thermometer still kept down among the
thirties. They were absolutely alone on the plain, except that now
and then a desperate wolf or inquisitive owl came by.
</p>
<p>
These were long days for the settlers. They would have been longer had
it not been for little Elga, or &#34;Flaxen,&#34; 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_033" id="Page_033">33</a></span>
as they took to calling her. They racked their brains to amuse her,
and in the intervals of tending the cattle and of cooking, or of
washing dishes, rummaged through all their books and pictures,
taught her &#34;cat's cradle,&#34; played &#34;jack-straws&#34; 
with her, and with all their resources of song and pantomime
strove to fill up the little one's lonely days, happy when they
succeeded in making her laugh.
</p>
<p>
&#34;That settles it!&#34; said Bert one day, whanging the basin
back into the empty flour-barrel.
</p>
<p>
&#34;What's the matter?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Matter is, we've reached the bottom o' the flour-barrel, an'
it's got to be filled; no two ways about that. We can get along
on biscuit an' pancakes in place o' meat, but we can't put anythin'
in the place o' bread. If it looks favorable to-morrow, we've got
to make a break for Summit an' see if we can't stock up.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Early the next morning they brought out the shivering team and piled
into the box all the quilts and robes they had, and bundling little
Flaxen in, started across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_034" id="Page_034">34</a></span>
the trackless plain toward the low line of hills to the east,
twenty-five or thirty miles. From four o'clock in the morning till
nearly noon they toiled across the sod, now ploughing through the
deep snow where the unburned grass had held it, now scraping across
the bare, burned earth, now wandering up or down the swales, seeking
the shallowest places, now shovelling a pathway through.
</p>
<p>
The sun rose unobscured as usual, and shone down with unusual warmth,
which afforded the men the satisfaction of seeing little Flaxen warm
and merry. She chattered away in her own tongue, and clapped her little
hands in glee at sight of the snowbirds running and fluttering about.
As they approached the low hills the swales got deeper and more
difficult to cross, but about eleven o'clock they came to Burdon's
Ranch, a sort of half-way haven between their own claim and Summit,
the end of the railway.
</p>
<p>
Captain Burdon was away, but Mrs. Burdon, a big, slatternly
Missourian, with all the kindliness of a universal mother in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_035" id="Page_035">35</a></span>
her swarthy face and flaccid bosom, ushered them into the cave-like
dwelling set in the sunny side of Water Moccasin.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Set down, set right down. Young uns, git out some o' them cheers
an' let the strangers set. Purty tol'able tough weather? A feller
don't git out much such weather as this 'ere 'thout he's jes' naturally
'bleeged to. Suse, heave in another twist, an' help the little un to
take off her shawl.&#34;
</p>
<p>
After Mrs. Burdon's little flurry of hospitality was over, Anson found
time to tell briefly the history of the child.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Heavens to Betsey! I wan' to know!&#34; she cried, her fat hands
on her knees and her eyes bulging. &#34;Wal! wal! I declare, it beats
the Dutch! So that woman jest frizzed right burside the babe! Wal, I
never! An' the ol' man he ain't showed up? Wal, now, he ain't likely to.
I reckon I saw that Norsk go by here that very day, an' I says to Cap'n,
says I, 'If that feller don't reach home inside an hour, he'll go through
heaven a-gittin' home,' says I to the Cap'n.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_036" id="Page_036">36</a></span>
&#34;Well, now,&#34; said Anson, stopping the old woman's garrulous flow,
&#34;I've got to be off f'r Summit, but I wish you'd jest look after this
little one here till we git back. It's purty hard weather f'r her to be
out, an' I don't think she ought to.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yaas; leave her, o' course. She'll enjoy playin' with the young
uns. I reckon y' did all y' could for that woman. Y' can't burry her
now; the ground's like linkum-vity.&#34;
</p>
<p>
But as Anson turned to leave, the little creature sprang up with a
torrent of wild words, catching him by the coat, and pleading
strenuously to go with him. Her accent was unmistakable.
</p>
<p>
&#34;You wan' to go with Ans?&#34; he inquired, looking down into the
little tearful face with a strange stirring in his bachelor heart.
&#34;I believe on my soul she does.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Sure's y're born!&#34; replied Mrs. Burdon. &#34;She'd rather go
with you than to stay an' fool with the young uns; that's what she's
tryin' to say.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_037" id="Page_037">37</a></span>
&#34;Do y' wan' to go?&#34; asked Ans again, opening his arms. She sprang
toward him, raising her eager little hands as high as she could, and when
he lifted her she twined her arms around his neck.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Poor little critter! she ain't got no pap ner mam now,&#34; the
old woman explained to the ring of children, who still stared silently
at the stranger almost without moving.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Ain't he her pa-a-p?&#34; drawled one of the older girls, sticking
a finger at Anson.
</p>
<p>
&#34;He is now,&#34; laughed Ans, and that settled the question over
which he had been pondering for days. It meant that as long as she
wanted to stay she should be his Flaxen and he would be her &#34;pap.&#34; 
&#34;And you can be Uncle Bert, hey?&#34; he said to Bert.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Good enough,&#34; said Bert.

<p class="head">
FLAXEN BECOMES INDISPENSABLE TO THE TWO OLD BACHELORS.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
They never found any living relative, and only late in the spring was
the fate of the poor father revealed. He and his cattle were found side
by side in a deep swale, where they had foundered in the night and tempest.
</p>
<p>
As for little Flaxen, she soon recovered her cheerfulness, with the
buoyancy natural to childhood, and learned to prattle in broken English
very fast. She developed a sturdy self-reliance that was surprising in
one so young, and long before spring came was indispensable to the two
&#34;old baches.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Now, Bert,&#34; said Ans one day, &#34;I don't wan' to hear you talk
in that slipshod way any longer before Flaxen. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_039" id="Page_039">39</a></span>
know better; you've had more chance than I have&mdash;be'n to school
more. They ain't no excuse for you, not an ioty. Now, I'm goin' to
say to her, 'Never mind how I talk, but talk like Bert does.'&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, say, now, look here, Ans, I can't stand the strain. Suppose
she'd hear me swearin' at ol' Barney or the stove?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;That's jest it. You ain't goin' to swear,&#34; decided Anson; and
after that Bert took the education of the little waif in hand, for he
was a man of good education; his use of dialect and slang sprang mainly
from carelessness.
</p>
<p>
But all the little fatherly duties and discipline fell to Anson, and
much perplexed he often got. For instance, when he bought her an outfit
of American clothing at the store they were strange to her and to him,
and the situation was decidedly embarrassing when they came to try them.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Now, Flaxie, I guess this thing goes on this side before, so's you can
button it. If it went on so, you <em>couldn't</em> reach around to button
it, don't you see? I guess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_040" id="Page_040">40</a></span>
you'd better try it so. An' this thing, I judge, is a shirt, an' goes on
under that other thing, which I reckon is called a shimmy. Say, Bert,
shouldn't you call that a shirt?&#34; holding up a garment.
</p>
<p>
&#34;W-e-l-l, yes&#34; (after a close scrutiny). &#34;Yes: I should.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;And this a shimmy?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, now, you've got me, Ans. It seems to me I've heard the women
folks home talk about shimmies, but they were always kind o' private
about it, so I don't think I can help you out. That little thing goes
underneath, sure enough.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;All right, here goes, Flax; if it should turn out to be hind side
before, no matter.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Then again little Flaxen would want to wear her best dress on week-days,
and Ans was unable to explain. Here again Bert came to the rescue.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Git her one dress fer ev'ry day in the week, an' make her wear
'em in rotation. Hang 'em up an' put a tag on each one&mdash;Sunday,
Monday, an' so on.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Good idea.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_041" id="Page_041">41</a></span>
And it was done. But the embarrassments of attending upon the child
soon passed away; she quickly grew independent of such help, dressed
herself, and combed her own hair, though Anson enjoyed doing it
himself when he could find time, and she helped out not a little
about the house. She seemed to have forgotten her old life, awakening
as she had from almost deathly torpor into a new home&mdash;almost a
new world&mdash;where a strange language was spoken, where no woman was,
and where no mention of her mother, father, or native land was ever made
before her. The little waif was at first utterly bewildered, then
reconciled, and by the time spring came over the prairie was almost
happy in the touching way of a child deprived of childish things.
</p>
<p>
Oh, how sweet spring seemed to those snow-weary people! Day after day
the sun crept higher up in the sky; day after day the snow gave way a
little on the swells, and streams of water began to trickle down under
the huge banks of snow, filling the ravines; and then at last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_042" id="Page_042">42</a></span>
came a day when a strange, warm wind blew from the northwest. Soft and sweet
and sensuous it was, as if it swept some tropic bay filled with a thousand
isles&mdash;a wind like a vast warm breath blown upon the land. Under
its touch the snow did not melt; it vanished. It fled in a single day
from the plain to the gullies. Another day, and the gullies were rivers.
</p>
<p>
It was the &#34;chinook,&#34; which old Lambert, the trapper and surveyor,
said came from the Pacific Ocean.
</p>
<p>
The second morning after the chinook began to blow, Anson sprang to his
feet from his bunk, and standing erect in the early morning light, yelled:
&#34;Hear that?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;What is it?&#34; asked Bert.
</p>
<p>
&#34;There! Hear it?&#34; Anson smiled, holding up his hand
joyfully as a mellow &#34;Boom&mdash;boom&mdash;boom&#34; broke
through the silent air. &#34;Prairie-chickens! Hurrah! Spring
has come! That breaks the back o' winter short off.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Hurrah! de 'pring ees come!&#34; cried little Flaxen, gleefully
clapping her hands in imitation.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_043" id="Page_043">43</a></span>
No man can know what a warm breeze and the note of a bird can mean
to him till he is released, as these men were released, from the
bondage of a horrible winter. Perhaps still more moving was the
thought that with the spring the loneliness of the prairie would
be broken, never again to be so dread and drear; for with the
coming of spring came the tide of land-seekers pouring in: teams
scurried here and there on the wide prairie, carrying surveyors,
land agents, and settlers. At Summit trains came rumbling in by
the first of April, emptying thousands of men, women, and children
upon the sod, together with cattle, machinery, and household
articles, to lie there roofed only by the blue sky. Summit, from
being a half-buried store and a blacksmith's shop, bloomed out
into a town with saloons, lumber-yards, hotels, and restaurants;
the sound of hammer and anvil was incessant, and trains clanged
and whistled night and day.
</p>
<p>
Day after day the settlers got their wagons together and loaded up,
and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044">44</a></span>
moved down the slope into the fair valley of the sleepy James. Mrs.
Cap Burdon did a rushing business as a hotel-keeper, while Cap sold
hay and oats at rates which made the land-seekers gasp.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I'm not out here f'r my health,&#34; was all the explanation
he ever made.
</p>
<p>
Soon all around the little shanty of Anson and Bert other shanties
were built and filled with young, hopeful, buoyant souls. The railway
surveyors came through, locating a town about three and another about
twelve miles away, and straightway the bitter rivalry between Boomtown
and Belleplain began. Belleplain being their town, Bert and Anson
swore by Belleplain, and correspondingly derided the claims of 
Boomtown.
</p>
<p>
With the coming of spring began the fiercest toil of the
pioneers&mdash;breaking the sod, building, harvesting, ploughing;
then the winter again, though not so hard to bear; then the same
round of work again. So the land was settled, the sod was turned
over; sod shanties gave way to little frame houses; the tide of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045">45</a></span>
land-seekers passed on, the boom burst, but the real workers, like
Wood and Gearheart, went patiently, steadily on, founding a great State.
</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046">46</a></span>
<h2><a href="#contents">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="head">
A QUESTION OF DRESS.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
One morning eight years later Flaxen left the home of Gearheart and
Wood with old Doll and the buggy, bound for Belleplain after groceries
for harvest. She drove with a dash, her hat on the back of her head.
She was seemingly intent on getting all there was possible out of a
chew of kerosene gum, which she had resolved to throw away upon
entering town, intending to get a new supply.
</p>
<p>
She had thriven on Western air and gum, and though hardly more than
fourteen years of age, her bust and limbs revealed the grace of
approaching womanhood, however childish her short dress and
braided hair might still show her to be. Her face was large and
decidedly of Scandinavian type, fair in spite of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_047" id="Page_047">47</a></span>
wind and sun, and broad at the cheekbones. Her eyes were as blue and
clear as winter ice.
</p>
<p>
As she rode along she sang as well as she could without neglecting
the gum, sitting at one end of the seat like a man, the reins held
carelessly in her left hand, notwithstanding the swift gait of the
horse, who always knew when Flaxen was driving. She met a friend on
the road, and said, &#34;Hello!&#34; pulling up her horse with one
strong hand.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Can't stop,&#34; she explained; &#34;got to go over to the city
to get some groceries for harvest. Goin' to the sociable to-morrow?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;You bet,&#34; replied the friend, &#34;You?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I d'know; mebbe, if the boys'll go. Ta-ta; see ye later.&#34;
And away she spun.
</p>
<p>
Belleplain had not thriven, or, to be more exact, it had had a rise
and fall; and as the rise had been considerable, so the fall was
something worth chronicling. It was now a collection of wooden
buildings, mostly empty, graying under the storms and suns of
pitiless winters and 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048">48</a></span>
summers, and now, just in mid-summer, surrounded by splendid
troops and phalanxes of gorgeous sunflowers, whose brown crowns,
gold-dusted, looked ever toward the sun as it swung through the
wide arch of cloudless sky. The signs of the empty buildings
still remained, and one might still read the melancholy decline
from splendours of the past in &#34;emporiums,&#34; &#34;palace
drug stores,&#34; and &#34;mansion-houses.&#34;
</p>
<p>
As Flaxen would have said, &#34;Belleplain's boom had bu'sted.&#34;
Her glory had gone with the C., B. and Q., which formed the junction
at Boomtown and left the luckless citizens of Belleplain &#34;high
and dry&#34; on the prairie, with nothing but a &#34;spur&#34; to
travel on. However, a few stores yet remained in the midst of 
desolation.
</p>
<p>
After making her other purchases, Flaxen entered the &#34;red-front
drug store&#34; to secure the special brand of gum which seemed most
delectable and to buy a couple of cigars for the &#34;boys.&#34;
</p>
<p>
The clerk, who was lately from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049">49</a></span>
East, and wore his moustache curled upward like the whiskers of a cat,
was &#34;gassing&#34; with another young man, who sat in a chair
with his heels on the counter.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, my dear, what can I do for you to-day?&#34; he said,
winking at the loafer, as if to say, &#34;Now watch me.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I want some gum.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;What kind, darling?&#34; he asked, encouraged by the
fellow in the chair.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I ain't your darling.&mdash;Kerosene, shoofly, an' ten cents' worth.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say, Jack,&#34; drawled the other fellow, &#34;git onto the ankles!
Say, sissy, you picked your dress too soon. She's goin' to be a daisy,
first you know. Ain't y', honey?&#34; he said, leaning over and
pinching her arm.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Let me alone, you great, mean thing! I'll tell ol' pap on you,
see if I don't,&#34; cried Flaxen, her eyes filling with angry tears.
And as they proceeded to other and bolder remarks she rushed out,
feeling vaguely the degradation of being so spoken to and so touched.
It seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_050" id="Page_050">50</a></span>
become more atrocious the more she thought upon it.
</p>
<p>
When she reached home there were still signs of tears on her face,
and when Anson came out to help her alight, and noticing it asked,
&#34;What's the matter?&#34; she burst out afresh, crying, and
talking incoherently. Anson was astonished.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Why, what's the matter, Flaxie? Can't you tell ol' pap?
Are ye sick?&#34;
</p>
<p>
She shook her head, and rushed past him into the house and into
her bedroom, like a little cyclone of wrath. Ans slowly followed
her, much perplexed. She was lying face downward on the bed, sobbing.
</p>
<p>
&#34;What's the matter, little one? Can't y' tell ol' pap?
Have the girls be'n makin' fun o' yeh again?&#34;
</p>
<p>
She shook her head.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Have the boys be'n botherin' yeh?&#34; No reply. &#34;Who was
it?&#34; Still silence. He was getting stern now. &#34;Tell me right
now.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Jack Reeves&mdash;an'&mdash;an' another feller.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wha' d' they do?&#34; Silence. &#34;Tell me.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_051" id="Page_051">51</a></span>
&#34;They&mdash;pinched me, an'&mdash;an'&mdash;talked mean to me,&#34;
she replied, breaking down again with the memory of the insult.
</p>
<p>
Anson began to understand.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, there! You dry y'r eyes, Flaxie, an' go an' git supper;
they won't do it again&mdash;not
<em>
this
</em>
harvest,&#34; he added grimly as he marched to the door to enter the buggy.
</p>
<p>
Bert, coming along from the barn and seeing Anson about to drive away,
asked where he was going. Anson tried to look indifferent.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, I've got a little business to transact with Reeves and
some other smart Aleck downtown.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;What's up? What have they be'n doing?&#34; asked Gearheart,
reading trouble in the eyes of his friend.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, they have be'n a little too fresh with Flaxen to-day,
an' need a lesson.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;They're equal to it. Say, Anson, let me go,&#34; laying his
hand on the dasher, ready to leap in.
</p>
<p>
&#34;No: you're too brash. You wouldn't know when to quit. No:
you stay right 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052">52</a></span>
here. Don't say anything to Flaxen about it; if she wants to know
where I'm gone, tell her I found I was out o' nails.&#34;
</p>
<p>
As Anson drove along swiftly he was in a savage mood and thinking
deeply. Two or three times of late some of his friends had touched
rather freely upon the fact that Flaxen was becoming a woman. 
&#34;Girls ripen early out in this climate,&#34; one old chap had
said, &#34;and your little Norsk there is likely to leave you one
of these days.&#34; He felt now that something deliberately and
inexpressibly offensive had been said and done to his little girl.
He didn't want to know just what it was, but just who did it;
that was all. It was time to make a protest.
</p>
<p>
Hitching his horse to a ring in the sidewalk upon arrival, he
walked into the drug store, which was also the post-office.
Young Reeves was inside the post-office corner giving out the
mail, and Anson sauntered about the store waiting his chance.
</p>
<p>
He was a dangerous-looking man just now. Ordinarily his vast frame,
huge, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_053" id="Page_053">53</a></span>
grizzled beard, and stern, steady eyes would quell a panther; but
now as he leaned against the counter a shrewd observer would have
said, &#34;Lookout for him; he's dangerous.&#34;
</p>
<p>
His gray shirt, loose at the throat, showed a neck that resembled
the spreading base of an oak tree, and his crossed limbs and
half-recumbent pose formed a curious opposition to the look in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
Nobody noticed him specially. Most comers and goers, being occupied
with their mail, merely nodded and passed on.
</p>
<p>
Finally some one called for a cigar, and Reeves, having finished in
the post-office department, came jauntily along behind the counter
directly to where Anson stood. As he looked casually into the giant's
eyes he started back, but too late; one vast hand had clutched him
by the collar, and he was jerked over the counter and cuffed from
hand to hand, like a mouse in the paws of a cat. Though Ans used
his open palm, the punishment was fearful. Blood burst from his
victim's nose and mouth; he yelled with fright and pain.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_054" id="Page_054">54</a></span>
The rest rushed to help.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Stand back! This is a private affair,&#34; said Ans, throwing up
a warning hand. They paused; all knew his strength.
</p>
<p>
&#34;It wasn't me!&#34; screamed Reeves as the punishment increased;
&#34;it was Doc Coe.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Coe, his hands full of papers and letters, horrified at what had
overtaken Reeves, stood looking on. But now he tried to escape. 
Flinging the battered, half-senseless Reeves back over the counter,
where he lay in a heap, Anson caught Coe by the coat just as he was
rushing past him, and duplicated the punishment, ending by kicking
him into the street, where he lay stunned and helpless. Ans said
then, in a voice that the rest heard, &#34;The next time you insult
a girl, you'd better inquire into the qualities of her guardeen.&#34;
</p>
<p>
This little matter attended to, he unhitched his horse from the
sidewalk, and refusing to answer any questions, rode off home,
outwardly as calm as though he had just been shaking hands.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_055" id="Page_055">55</a></span>
Supper was about ready when he drove up, and through the open door
he could see the white-covered table and could hear the cheerful
clatter of dishes. Flaxen was whistling. Eight years of hard work
had not done much for these sturdy souls, but they had managed to
secure with incredible toil a comfortable little house surrounded
with outbuildings. Calves and chickens gave life to the barn-yard,
and fields of wheat rippled and ran with swash of heavy-bearded
heads and dapple of shadow and sheen.
</p>
<p>
Flaxen was now the housewife and daughter of these hard-working
pioneers, and a cheery and capable one she had become. No one had
ever turned up with a better claim to her, and so she had grown up
with Ans and Bert, going to school when she could spare the time,
but mainly being adviser and associate at the farm.
</p>
<p>
Ans and Bert had worked hard winter and summer trying to get ahead,
but had not succeeded as they had hoped. Crops had failed for three
or four years, and money was scarce with them; but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056">56</a></span>
had managed to build this small frame house and to get a little stock
about them, and this year, with a good crop, would &#34;swing clear,&#34;
and be able to do something for Flaxen&mdash;perhaps send her to
Belleplain to school, togged out like a little queen.
</p>
<p>
When Anson returned to the house after putting out the horse, he found
Bert reading the paper in the little sitting-room and Flaxen putting the
tea on the stove.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wha' d' y' do to him, pap?&#34; laughed she, all her anger gone.
Bert came out to listen.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, nothin' p'tic'lar,&#34; answered Ans, flinging his hat at a
chicken that made as though to come in, and rolling up his sleeves
preparatory to sozzling his face at the sink. &#34;I jest cuffed 'em
a little, an' let 'em go.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Is that all?&#34; said Flaxen, disappointedly, a comical
look on her round face.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Now, don't you worry,&#34; put in Bert. &#34;Anson's cuffin' a man
is rather severe experience. I saw him cuff a man once; it ain't anythin'
to be desired a second time.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_057" id="Page_057">57</a></span>
They all drew about the table. Flaxen looked very womanly as she sat
cutting the bread and pouring the tea. She had always been old in her
ways about the house, for she had very early assumed the housewife's
duties and cares. Her fresh-coloured face beamed with delight as she
watched the hungry men devouring the fried pork, potatoes, and cheese.
</p>
<p>
&#34;When y' goin' to begin cuttin', boys?&#34; Collectively they were
boys to her, but when addressing them separately they were &#34;Bert&#34;
and &#34;Pap.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;To-morrow 'r nex' day, I guess,&#34; answered Anson, looking out of
the open door. &#34;Don't it look fine&mdash;all yeller an' green? I tell
ye they ain't anything lays over a ripe field o' wheat in my eyes. You
jest take it when the sun strikes it right, an' the wind is playin' on
it&mdash;when it kind o' sloshes around like water&mdash;an' the clouds
go over it, droppin' shadders down on it, an' a hawk kind o' goes skimmin'
over it, divin' into it once in a while&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
He did not finish; it was not necessary.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_058" id="Page_058">58</a></span>
&#34;Yes, sir!&#34; adjudged Gearheart, after a pause, leaning his
elbows on the table and looking out of the door on the far-stretching,
sun-glorified plain.
</p>
<p>
&#34;The harvest kind o' justifies the winter we have out here.
That is, when we have a harvest such as this. Fact is, we fellers
live six months o' the year lookin' ahead to harvest, an' t'other
six months lookin' back to it. Well, this won't buy the woman a
dress, Ans. We must get that header set up to-night if we can.&#34;
</p>
<p>
They pushed their chairs back noisily and rose to go out. Flaxen said:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say, which o' you boys is goin' to help me churn to-night?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Anson groaned, while she laughed.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I don't know, Flax; ask us an easier one.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;We'll attend to that after it gets too dark to work on the
machine,&#34; added Bert.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, see 't y' do. I can't do it; I've got bread to mix an' a
chicken to dress. Say, if you don't begin cuttin' till day after
to-morrow, we can go down to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_059" id="Page_059">59</a></span>
sociable to-morrow night. Last one o' the season.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I wish it was the last one before the kingdom come,&#34; growled
Bert as he &#34;stomped&#34; out the door. &#34;They're a bad lot.
The idea o' takin' down four dollars' worth o' grub an' then payin'
four dollars for the privilege of eatin' half of it! I'll take my
chicken here, when I'm hungry.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Bert ain't partial to sociables, is he, pap?&#34; laughed Flaxen.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I should hate to have the minister dependin' on Bert for a livin'.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Sa-ay, pap!&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, babe?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I expect I'll haf t' have a new dress one o' these days.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Think so?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;You bet.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Why, what's the matter with the one y' got on? Ain't no holes in
it that I can see,&#34; looking at it carefully and turning her around
as if she were on a pivot.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, ain't it purty short, pap?&#34; she said suggestively.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_060" id="Page_060">60</a></span>
&#34;I swear, I don't know but it is,&#34; conceded Anson, scratching
his head; &#34;I hadn't paid much 'tention to it before. It certainly
is a lee-tle too short. Lemme see: ain't no way o' lettin' it down,
is they?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Nary. She's clean down to the last notch now,&#34; replied
Flaxen convincingly.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Couldn't pull through till we thrash?&#34; he continued,
still in a tentative manner.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Could, but don't like to,&#34; she answered, laughing again,
and showing her white teeth pleasantly.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I s'pose it'll cost suthin',&#34; he insinuated in a dubious tone.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Mattie Stuart paid seven dollars fer her'n, pap, an' I&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Seven how manys?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Dollars, pap, makin' an' everythin'. An' then I ought to have a
new hat to go with the dress, an' a new pair o' shoes. All the girls
are wearin' white, but I reckon I can git along with a good coloured
one that'll do fer winter.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, all right. I'll fix it&mdash;some way,&#34; Ans said, turning
away only to look back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_061" id="Page_061">61</a></span>
and smile to see her dancing up and down and crying:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, goody, goody!&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I'll do it if I haf to borrow money at two per cent a month,&#34;
said he to Bert, as he explained the case. &#34;Hear her sing! Why,
dern it! I'd spend all I've got to keep that child twitterin' like
that. Wouldn't you, eh?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Bert was silent, thinking deeply on a variety of matters suggested by
Anson's words. The crickets were singing from out the weeds near by;
a lost little wild chicken was whistling in plaintive sweetness down
in the barley-field; the flaming light from the half-sunk sun swept
along the green and yellow grain, glorifying as with a bath of gold
everything it touched.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I wish that grain hadn't ripened so fast, Ans. It's blightin'.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Think so?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;No: I know it. I went out to look at it before supper, an' every
one of those spots that look so pretty are just simply burnin' up!
But, say, ain't it a little singular that Flaxen should blossom out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_062" id="Page_062">62</a></span>
in a desire for a new dress all at once? Ain't it rather sudden?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, no: I don't think it is. Come to look it all over, up one side
an' down the other, she's been growin' about an inch a month this summer,
an' her best dress is gittin' turrible short the best way you can fix it.
She's gittin' to be 'most a woman, Bert.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes: I know she is,&#34; said Bert, significantly. &#34;An'
something's got to be done right off.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wha' d' ye mean by that, ol' man?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I mean jest this. It's time we did something religious for that
girl. She ain't had much chance since she's been here with us. She
ain't had no chance at all. Now I move that we send her away to school
this winter. Give her a good outfit an' send her away. This ain't no
sort o' way for a girl to grow up in.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, I've be'n thinkin' o' that myself; but where'll we send her?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, back to the States somewhere; Wisconsin or
Minnesota&mdash;somewhere.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Why not to Boomtown?&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_063" id="Page_063">63</a></span>
&#34;Well, I'll tell yeh, Ans. I've been hearing a good 'eal off an' on
about the way we're bringin' her up here 'alone with two rough old
codgers,' an' I jest want to give her a better chance than the Territory
affords. I want her to git free of us and all like us, for a while; let
her see something of the world. Besides, that business over in Belleplain
to-day kind o' settled me. The plain facts are, Ans, the people are a
little too free with her because she is growin' up here&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I know some fellers that won't be again.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, they are beginnin' to wink an' nudge each other an' to
say&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Go on! What do they say?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;They say she's goin' to be a woman soon; that this fatherly
business is bound to play out.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I'd like to see anybody wink when I'm around. I'd smash 'em!&#34;
said Anson through his set teeth. &#34;Why, she's our little babe,&#34;
he broke out, as the full significance of the matter came to him. 
&#34;My little un; I'm her ol' pap. Why&mdash;&#34; 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_064" id="Page_064">64</a></span>
He ended in despair. &#34;It's none o' their darn business.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;There ain't no use o' howlin', Ans. You can't smash a whole
neighborhood.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;But what are we goin' to do?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, I'll tell ye what we mustn't do. We mustn't tog her out
jest yet.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Why not?&#34; asked Anson, not seeing these subtle distinctions
of time and place.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Because, you tog her out this week or next, without any apparent
reason, in a new hat an' dress an' gloves, an' go down to one o' these
sociables with her, an' you'd have to clean out the whole crowd. They'd
all be winkin' an' nudgin' an' grinnin'&mdash;see?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, go on,&#34; said the crushed giant. &#34;What'll we do?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Just let things go on as they are for the present till we git
ready to send her to school.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;But I promised the togs.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;All right. I've stated the case,&#34; Gearheart returned, with the
air of a man who washed his hands of the whole affair.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_065" id="Page_065">65</a></span>
Anson rose with a sudden gesture. &#34;Jest hear her! whistlin' away
like a lark. I don't see how I'm goin' to go in there an' spoil all
her fun; I can't do it, that's all.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, now, you leave it all to me. I'll state the case to her
in a way that'll catch her&mdash;see if I don't. She ain't no common
girl.&#34;
</p>
<p>
It was growing dark as they went in, and the girl's face could not
be seen.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, Bert, are y' ready to help churn?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes, I guess so, if Ans'll milk.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, he'll milk; he jest loves to milk ol' Brindle when the
flies are thick.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, you bet,&#34; said Ans, to make her laugh.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Now, Flaxen,&#34; coughed Gearheart in beginning, &#34;we've been
discussin' your case, an' we've come to the conclusion that you ought
to have the togs specified in the indictment&#34; (this to take away
the gravity of what was to follow); &#34;but we're kind o' up a tree
about just what we'd better do. The case is this. We've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_066" id="Page_066">66</a></span>
got to buy a horse to fill out our team, an' that's a-goin' to take
about all we can rake an' scrape.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;We may have to git our groceries on tick. Now, if you could only
pull through till after&mdash;&#34; Anson broke in.
</p>
<p>
&#34;It's purty tough, Flaxie, an' pap's awful sorry; but if you could
jest pull through&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
It was a great blow to poor little Flaxen, and she broke down and cried
unrestrainedly.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I&mdash;I&mdash;don't see why I can't have things like the rest o'
the girls.&#34; It was her first reproach, and it cut to the heart.
Anson swore under his breath, and was stepping forward to say something
when Gearheart restrained him.
</p>
<p>
&#34;But, y' see, Flaxie, we ain't askin' you to give up the dress,
only to wait on us for a month or so, till we thrash.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;That's it, babe,&#34; said Anson, going over to where she sat,
with her arms lying on the table and her face hidden upon them.
&#34;We could spend dollars then where we couldn't cents now.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_067" id="Page_067">67</a></span>
&#34;And they won't be any more thingumyjigs at the church, anyhow,
an' the wheat's blightin' on the knolls, besides.&#34;
</p>
<p>
But the first keen disappointment over, she was her brave self once
more.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, all right, boys,&#34; she said, her trembling voice
curiously at variance with her words; &#34;I'll get along somehow,
but I tell you I'll have something scrumptious to pay for
this&mdash;see if I don't.&#34; She was smiling again faintly,
&#34;It'll cost more'n <em>one</em> ten dollars for my togs, as
you call 'em. Now, pap, you go an' milk that cow! An', Bert, you
glue yerself to that churn-dasher, an' don't you stop to breathe
or swear till it's done.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;That's the girl to have&mdash;that's our own Flaxie! She knows
how hard things come on a farm,&#34; cheered Anson.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I bet I do,&#34; she said, wiping away the last trace of her
tears and smiling at her palpable hit. And then began the thump of
the dasher, and out in the dusk Anson was whistling as he milked.
</p>
<p>
She went down to the sociable the next night in her old dress,
and bravely looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_068" id="Page_068">68</a></span>
happy for pap's sake. Bert did not go. Anson was a rather handsome
old fellow. Huge, bearded like a Russian, though the colour of his
beard was a wolf brindle, resembling a bunch of dry buffalo-grass,
Bert was accustomed to say that he looked the father of the girl,
for she had the same robust development, carried herself as erect,
and looked everybody in the eye with the same laughing directness.
</p>
<p>
There were some sly remarks among a ribald few, but on the whole
everything passed off as usual. They were both general favorites,
and as a matter of fact few people remarked that Flaxen's dress
was not good enough. She certainly forgot all about it, so
complete was her absorption in the gayety of the evening.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, now for four weeks' hard times, Flaxen,&#34; said Anson,
as they were jogging homeward about eleven o'clock.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I can stand <em>my</em> share of it, pap,&#34; she stoutly
replied. &#34;I'm no chicken.&#34;

<p class="head">
AFTER HARVEST.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
All through those four or five weeks, at every opportunity, the
partners planned the future of their waif. In the harvest-field,
when they had a moment together, one would say to the other:
</p>
<p>
&#34;We'll let her stay two years if she likes it, eh?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Certainly; she needn't come back till she wants to. We may
be rich enough to sell out then, and move back ourselves. I'm
gittin' tired o' this prairie myself. If we could sell, we'd
put her through a whole course o' sprouts.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;You bet! Sell when you can find a buyer. I'll sign the deed.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;All right.&#34;
</p>
<p>
And then they would go to work again toiling and planning for
the future. Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_070" id="Page_070">70</a></span>
day during August these men worked with the energy of demons, up early
in the morning and out late at night, harvesting their crop. All day
the header clattered to and fro with Bert or Ans astride the rudder,
a cloud of dust rolling up from the ground, out of which the painted
flanges of the reel flashed like sword-strokes. All day, and day after
day; while the gulls sailed and soared in the hazy air and the larks
piped from the dun grass, these human beings, covered with grime and
sweat, worked in heat and parching wind. And never for an hour did they
forget their little waif and her needs. And she did her part in the
house. She rose as early as they and worked almost as late. It was
miraculous, they admitted.
</p>
<p>
One night toward the last of the harvest they were returning along
the road from a neighboring farm, where they had been to head some
late wheat. The tired horses with down-hung heads and swinging
traces were walking sullenly but swiftly along the homeward road, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_071" id="Page_071">71</a></span>
wagon rumbling sleepily; the stars were coming out in the east, while
yet the rose and amethyst of the fallen sun lighted the western sky.
Through the air, growing moist, came the sound of reapers still going.
Men were shouting blithely, while voices of women and children came 
from the cabins, where yellow lights began to twinkle.
</p>
<p>
Anson and Bert, blackened with dust and perspiration and weary to the
point of listlessness, sat with elbows on knees, talking in low, slow
tones on the never-failing topic, crops and profits. Their voices
chimed with the sound of the wagon.
</p>
<p>
&#34;There's the light,&#34; broke out Ans, rousing himself and the team;
&#34;Flaxen's got supper all ready for us. She's a regular little Trojan,
that girl is. They ain't many girls o' fourteen that 'u'd stay there
contented all day alone an' keep all the whole business in apple-pie
order. She'll get her pay some day.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;We'll try to pay her; but say, ol' man, ain't it about time to
open up our plans to her?&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072">72</a></span>
&#34;Wal, yes; it is. You kind o' start the thing to-night, an' we'll
have it over with.&#34;
</p>
<p>
As they drove up, Flaxen came to the door. &#34;Hello, boys!
What makes ye so late?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Finishin' up a field, babe. All done.&#34;
</p>
<p>
She clapped her hands and danced up and down.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Goody! all done at last. Well, yank them horses out o' their
harnesses an' come to biscuits. They're jest sizzlin' hot.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;All right. We'll be there in about two jerks of a lamb's tail
in fly-time. Bert, grab a tug; I'm hungry as a wolf.&#34;
</p>
<p>
It was about the first of September and the nights were getting
cool, and the steaming supper seemed like a feast to the chilled
and stiffened men coming in a little later and sitting down with
the sound of the girl's cheery voice in their ears. The tea was
hot; so were the biscuits. The pyramid of hot mashed potato had
a lump of half-melted butter in the hollow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_073" id="Page_073">73</a></span>
top, and there were canned peaches and canned salmon.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes: we're about finished up harvestin',&#34; said Bert, as
they settled themselves at the table, &#34;an' it's about time to
talk about gittin' you off to school.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Don't worry about that. It ain't no great job, I reckon. I
can git ready in about seventeen jiffies, stop-watch time.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Not if you are goin' away off to some city in the
East&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes: but I ain't, y' see.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, yes, you are. Bert an' I've be'n talkin' it all over f'r
the last three weeks. We're goin' to send you back to St. Peter
to the seminary.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I guess not, pap. I'd like to know what you think you're a-doin'
sendin' me 'way back there. Boomtown's good enough fer me.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;There, there, Flaxie; don't git mad. Y' see, we think they ain't
anythin' good enough for you. Nothin' too good for a girl that stays
to home an' cooks f'r two old cusses&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;You ain't cusses! You're jest as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_074" id="Page_074">74</a></span>
good as you can be; but I ain't a-goin'&mdash;there!&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Why not?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;'Cause I ain't; that's why.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Why, don't y' wan' to go back there where the people have nice
houses, an' where they's a good&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, I don't know enough; that's why. I ain't goin' back to no
seminary to be laughed at 'cause I don't know beans.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;But you do,&#34; laughed Bert, with an attempt to lighten the
gloom&mdash;&#34;you know canned beans.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;They'd laff at me, I know, an' call me a little Norsk.&#34; 
She was ready to cry.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I'll bet they won't, not when they see our new dress an' our
new gold watch&mdash;dress jest the color o' crow's-foot grass,
watch thirty carats fine. I'd laugh to see 'em callin' my babe
names then!&#34;
</p>
<p>
And so by bribing, coaxing, and lying they finally obtained her
tearful consent. They might not have succeeded even then had it
not been for a young lady in Boomtown who was going back to the
same school, and who offered to take her in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_075" id="Page_075">75</a></span>
charge. But there was hardly a day that she did not fling herself
down into a chair and cry out:
</p>
<p>
&#34;I jest ain't goin'. I'm all right here, an' I don't see why you
can't let me stay here. <em>I</em> ain't made no fuss. Seems as if
you thought it was fun f'r me to go 'way off there where I don't
know anythin' an' where I don't know anybody.&#34;
</p>
<p>
But having come to a conclusion, the men were relentless. They hired
sewing-girls, and skirmished back and forth between Boomtown and the
farm like mad. Their steady zeal made up for her moody and fitful
enthusiasm. However, she grew more resigned to the idea as the days
wore on toward the departure, though her fits of dark and unusual
musing were alarming to Anson, who feared a desperate retreat at
the last moment.
</p>
<p>
He took her over to see Miss Holt one day, but not before he had
prepared the way.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I s'pose things are in purty good shape around this
seminary?&#34; he asked.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, yes, indeed. There are three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_076" id="Page_076">76</a></span>
large buildings; libraries, picture-galleries, and music-rooms.
The boarding-halls are carpeted and the parlors are really elegant.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Uh-hum!&#34; commented Anson. &#34;Well, now, I'm goin' to bring
my girl over to see you, an' I guess it 'u'd be jest as well if you
didn't mention these fineries an' things. Y' see, she's afraid of all
such things. It 'u'd be better to tell her that things weren't very
gorgeous there&mdash;about like the graded school in Boomtown, say.
She ain't used to these music-halls an' things. Kind o' make her
think St. Peter ain't no great shakes, anyhow.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I see,&#34; laughed the quick-witted girl. And she succeeded in
removing a good deal of Flaxen's dread of the seminary.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, babe, to-morrow,&#34; said Anson, as they were eating supper,
and he was astonished to see her break out in weeping.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Why don't you keep harpin' away on that the whole while?&#34; she
exclaimed. &#34;Can't you leave me alone a minute? Seems to me you're
jest crazy to git rid o' me.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_077" id="Page_077">77</a></span>
&#34;Oh, we are,&#34; put in Bert. &#34;We're jest lickin' our chops to
git back to sour flapjacks an' soggy bread. Jest seems as though we
couldn't wait till to-morrow noon, to begin doing our own cookin' again.&#34;
</p>
<p>
This cleared the air a little, and they spent the rest of the evening
without saying very much directly upon the departure. The two men sat
up late after Flaxen had gone to bed. There was the trunk and valise
which would not let them forget even for a moment what was coming on
the morrow. Every time Anson looked at her he sighed and tried to
swallow the lump in his throat.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say, Bert, let's let her stay if she wants to,&#34; he said suddenly
after they had been in silence for a long time.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Don't make a cussed fool of yourself, Ans,&#34; growled Bert, who
saw that heroic measures were necessary. &#34;Go to bed an' don't you
say another word; we've got to take our medicine like men.&#34;

<p class="head">
AN EMPTY HOUSE.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Anson was the more talkative of the two next morning, however.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Come, come, brace up, babe! Anybody 'u'd think we'd lost all the
rest of our family, when we're only doin' the square thing by our
daughter. That's all. Why, you'll be as happy as a canary in less'n
two weeks. Young folks is about the same everywhere, an' you'll git
acquainted in less'n two jiffies.&#34;
</p>
<p>
They were on the road to Boomtown to put Flaxen on the train. It was
about the tenth of September, early in the cold, crisp air of a perfect
morning. In the south there was a vast phantom lake, with duplicate
cities here and there along the winding shores, which stretched from
east to west. The grain-stacks stood around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_079" id="Page_079">79</a></span>
so thickly that they seemed like walls of a great, low-built town,
the mirage bringing into vision countless hundreds of them commonly
below the horizon.
</p>
<p>
The smoke of steam threshing-machines mounted into the still air here
and there, and hung long in a slowly drifting cloud above the land.
The prairie-lark, the last of the singing birds, whistled softly and
infrequently from the dry grass. The gulls were streaming south from
the lakes.
</p>
<p>
They were driving her to Boomtown to avoid the inquisitive eyes of the
good people of Belleplain. &#34;I may break down an' blubber,&#34; 
said Anson to Bert; &#34;an' if I do, I don't want them cussed idiots
standin' around laughin'&mdash;it's better to go on the 
C., B. and Q., anyhow.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding his struggle to keep talk going, Anson was unsuccessful
from the very moment that Belleplain faded to an unsubstantial group of
shadows and disappeared from the level plain into the air, just as
Boomtown correspondingly wavered into sight ahead. Silence so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_080" id="Page_080">80</a></span>
profound was a restraint on them all, and poor Flaxen with wide eyes
looked wistfully on the plain that stretched away into unknown regions.
She was thinking of her poor mother, whom she dimly remembered in the
horror of that first winter. Naturally of a gay, buoyant disposition,
she had not dwelt much upon her future or her past; but now that the
familiar plain seemed slipping from her sight entirely, she was
conscious of its beauty, and, rapt with the associated emotions which
came crowding upon her, she felt as though she were leaving the tried
and true for the unknown and uncertain.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Boys,&#34; she said finally, &#34;do you s'pose I've got any
folks?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I shouldn't wonder if y' had, babe, somewhere back in the ol'
country.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;They couldn't talk with me if I could find 'em, could they?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I reckon not, 'less you study so hard that you can learn their
lingo,&#34; said Ans, seeing another opportunity to add a reason for
going to school.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, boys, that's what I'm goin' to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_081" id="Page_081">81</a></span>
do, an' by an' by we'll go over there an' see if we can't find 'em,
won't we?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;That's the talk; now you're gittin' down to business,&#34; rejoined Ans.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I s'pose St. Peter is a good 'eal bigger'n Boomtown,&#34; she said
sighfully, as they neared the &#34;emporium of the sleepy James.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;A little,&#34; said the astute Gearheart.
</p>
<p>
The clanging of the engines and the noise of shouting gave her a
sinking sensation in the chest, and she clung to Anson's arm as
they drove past the engine. She was deafened by the hiss of the
escaping steam of the monster standing motionless, headed toward
the east, ready to leap on its sounding way.
</p>
<p>
On the platform they found Miss Holt and a number of other friends
waiting. There was a great deal of clanging and whanging and
scuffling, it seemed to the poor, overwrought girl. Miss Holt took
her in charge at once and tried to keep her cheerful. When they
had checked her trunk and the train was about ready to start, Ans
looked uneasy and fidgeted 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_082" id="Page_082">82</a></span>
about. Bert looked on, silent and dark. Flaxen, with her new long
dress and new hat, looked quite the woman, and Miss Holt greeted
her as such; indeed, she kept so close to her that Anson looked
in vain for a chance to say something more which was on his mind.
Finally, as the train was about going, he said hesitatingly:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Elga, jest a minute.&#34; She stared for a moment, then 
came up to him.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I didn't want to call y' Flaxen afore her,&#34; he explained;
&#34;but you&mdash;ain't&mdash;kissed us good-bye.&#34; He ended
hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>
The tears were already streaming down her cheeks, and this was too
much. She flung her arms about his neck and sobbed on his bosom
with the abandon of girlish grief.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I don't wan' to go 't all, pap.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, yes, y' do, Elga; yes; y' do! Don't mind us; we'll be all
right. I'll have Bert writin' a full half the time. There, kiss me
good-bye an' git on&mdash;Bert here, too.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_083" id="Page_083">83</a></span>
She kissed him twice through his bristling moustache, and going to Bert
offered her lips, and then came back to Anson and threw herself against
his broad, strong breast. She had no one to love but these two. It
seemed as if she were leaving everything in the world. Anson took her
on his firm arm and helped her on the car, and followed her till she
 was seated beside Miss Holt.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Don't cry, babe; you'll make ol' pap feel turrible. He'll break
right down here afore all these people, an' blubber, if y' don't cheer
up. Why, you'll soon be as happy as a fly in soup. Good-bye, good-bye!&#34;
</p>
<p>
The train started, and Anson, brushing his eyes with his great brown
hand, swung himself off and stood looking at her. As the train passed
him she rushed to the rear end of the car, and remained there looking
back at the little station till the sympathetic Miss Holt gently led
her back to her seat. Then she flattened her round cheek against the
pane and tried to see the boys. When the last house of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_084" id="Page_084">84</a></span>
town passed by her window she sank back in her seat and sobbed silently.
</p>
<hr class="break" />
<p>
&#34;I feel as if I'd be'n attendin' my own funeral,&#34; said Anson,
after they had got into their wagon and the train had gone out of
sight in the haze of the prairie.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, it's pretty tough on that child to go off that way. To her
the world is all a great mystery. When you an' I go to heaven it won't
be any greater change for us than this change for Flaxen&mdash;every
face strange, every spot new.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, she ain't far away but we can look out for her. She ain't
poor n'r fatherless as long as we live, hey?&#34;
</p>
<p>
And then silence fell on them. As they were jogging homeward they saw
the gray gulls rise from the sod and go home to the lake for the night.
They heard the crickets' evening chorus broaden and deepen to an
endless and monotonous symphony, while behind fantastic, thin, and
rainless clouds the sun sank in unspeakable glory of colour. The air,
perfectly still, was cool almost to frostiness, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_085" id="Page_085">85</a></span>
and, far above, the fair stars broke from the lilac and gold of the
sun-flushed sky. Lights in the farm-houses began to appear.
</p>
<p>
Once or twice Anson said: &#34;She's about at Summit now. I hope
she's chirked up.&#34;
</p>
<p>
They met threshing-crews going noisily home to supper. Once they
met an &#34;outfit,&#34; engine, tank, separator, all moving along
like a train of cars, while every few minutes the red light from
the furnace gleamed on the man who was stuffing the straw into the
furnace-door, bringing out his face so plainly that they knew him.
As the night grew deeper, an occasional owl flapped across the
fields in search of mice.
</p>
<p>
&#34;We're bound to miss her like thunder, Bert; no two ways about
that. Can't help but miss her on the cookin', hey?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Bert nodded without looking up. As they came in sight of home at last,
and saw the house silhouetted against the faintly yellow sky, Ans said
with a sigh:
</p>
<p>
&#34;No light an' no singin' there to-night.&#34;
</p>

<h2><a href="#contents">CHAPTER IX.</a>
</h2>
</div>
<p class="head">
&#34;BACHING&#34; IT AGAIN.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
&#34;The fact is, Flaxen has sp'iled us,&#34; laughed Anson, a couple
of days later, when Bert was cursing the soggy biscuit. &#34;We've got
so high-toned that we can't stand common cookin'. Time was we'd 'a'
thought ourselves lucky to git as good as that. Rec'lect them flapjacks
we ust to make? By mighty! you could shoe a horse with 'em. Say, I wish
I could jest slip in an' see what she's a-doin' about now, hey?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;She's probably writin' a letter. She won't do much of anythin'
else for the first week.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I hope you're right,&#34; said Anson.
</p>
<p>
They got a queer little letter every Wednesday, each one for several
weeks pitifully like the others.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="no-space-bottom">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_087" id="Page_087">87</a></span>
Dear boys i thought i would take my pen in hand to tell you i dont like
it one bit the school is just as mene as it can be the girls do laugh
at me they call me toe-head. if i catch em right i will fix their heads.
They is one girl who i like she is from pipestone she dont know no
moren i do she says my dress is pritty&mdash;ol nig an the drake all
rite i wish i was home.</p>
<p class="no-space-top sig sc">Elga.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The wish to be home was in all these letters like a sob. The men read them
over carefully and gravely, and finally Anson would put them away in the
Bible (bought on Flaxen's account) for safe-keeping.
</p>
<p>
As the letters improved in form their exultation increased.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say, Bert, don't you notice she writes better now? She makes big I's
now in place o' little ones. Seems 's if she runs the sentence all
together, though.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;She'll come out all right. You see, she goes into the preparatory
department, where they teach writin' an' spellin'. You'll see her hand
improve right along now.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_088" id="Page_088">88</a></span>
And it did, and she ceased to wail for home and ceased to say that
she hated her studies.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I am getting along splendid,&#34; she wrote some weeks after this.
&#34;I like my teacher; her name is Holt. She is just as nice as she
can be. She is cousin to the one who came with me; I live with her
uncle, and I can go to soshibles whenever I want to; but the other
girls cant. I am feeling pretty good, but I wish you boys was here.&#34;
</p>
<p>
She did not wish to be at home this time!
</p>
<p>
Winter shut down on the broad land again with that implacable,
remorseless brilliancy of fierce cold which characterises the
northern plain, stopping work on the farm and bolting all doors.
Hardly a day that the sun did not shine; but the light was hard,
white, glittering, and cold, the winds treacherous, the snow wild
and restless. There was now comparatively little danger of being
lost even in the fiercest storms, but still life in one of these
little cabins had an isolation almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_089" id="Page_089">89</a></span>
as terrible as that of a ship wedged amid the ice-floes of the
polar regions.
</p>
<p>
Day after day rising to feed the cattle, night after night bending
over the sooty stove listening to the ceaseless voice of the wind
as it beat and brushed, whispered, moaned, and piped or screamed
around the windows and eaves&mdash;this was their life, varied with
an occasional visit to the store or the post-office, or by the call
of a neighbour. It is easy to conceive that Flaxen's bright letters
were like bursts of bird-song in their loneliness. Many of the young
men, their neighbours, went back East to spend the winter&mdash;back
to Michigan, Iowa, New York, or elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Ans, why don't you go back an' visit your folks?&#34; asked Bert,
one day. &#34;I'll take care o' things.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, the fact is, I've be'n away so long they don't care whether
I'm alive er dead. I ain't got no near relatives except a sister, an'
she's got all the fam'ly she can 'tend to.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Same here. We ain't very affectionate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_090" id="Page_090">90</a></span>
anyway; our fam'ly and I don't write. Still I'd like to go back,
just to see how they all are.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Why not go?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, I don't know. I guess I must one o' these days. I've kind
o' be'n waitin' till we got into a little better shape. I hate to go
back poor.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;So do I. It's hard work f'r me to give up beat; I ain't goin'
to do it yet awhile.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Sometimes a neighbour dropped in during the middle of the day, and
on pleasant days they would harness up the team and take a drive
down to the store and the post-office; but mainly they vegetated
like a couple of huge potatoes in a cellar, as did most of the
settlers. There was nothing else to do.
</p>
<p>
It was the worst winter since the first that they had spent in the
country. The snow seemed never still. It slid, streamed, rose in
the air ceaselessly; it covered the hay, drifted up the barn door,
swept the fields bare, and, carrying the dirt of the ploughed
fields with it, built huge black 
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_091" id="Page_091">91</a></span>
drifts wherever there was a wind-break, corn-field, or other obstruction.
</p>
<p>
There were moments when Bert was well-nigh desperate. Only contact with
hard work and cold winds saved him. He was naturally a more ambitious,
more austere man than Anson. He was not content to vegetate, but longed
to escape. He felt that he was wasting his life.
</p>
<p>
It was in December that the letter first came from Flaxen which
mentioned Will Kendall.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
O boys! I had the best time. We had a party at our house and lots of
boys came and girls too, and they were nice, the boys, I mean. Will
Kendall he is the nicest feller you ever seen. He has got black eyes
and brown hair and a gold watch-chain with a locket with some girl's
hair in it, and he said it was his sister's hair, but I told him I
didn't believe it, do you? We had cake and popcorn and lasses candy;
and Will he took me out to supper.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bert was reading the letter, and at this point he stopped and raised
his eyes, and the two men gazed at each other without
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_092" id="Page_092">92</a></span>
a word for a long time. Then Anson laughed.
</p>
<p>
&#34;She's gittin' over her homesickness. She's all right now she's got
out to a sociable.&#34;
</p>
<p>
After that there was hardly a letter that did not mention Kendall in some
innocent fashion among the other boys and girls who took part in the
sleigh-rides, parties, and sociables. But the morbidly acute Bert, if he
saw, said nothing, and Anson did not see.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Who d' y' s'pose this Kendall is?&#34; asked Anson, one night late
in the winter, of Gearheart, who was reading the paper while his
companion reread a letter from Flaxen. &#34;Seems to me she's writin'
a good 'eal about him lately.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, some slick little dry-goods clerk or druggist,&#34; said Bert,
with unwarrantable irritation.
</p>
<p>
&#34;She seems to have a good 'eal to say about him, anyway,&#34; repeated Anson, in a meditative way.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, that's natural enough. They are two young folks together,&#34;
replied Bert,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_093" id="Page_093">93</a></span>
with a careless accent, to remove any suspicion which his hasty utterance
might have raised in Anson's mind.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, I guess you're right,&#34; agreed Anson, after a pause, relieved.
This relief was made complete when in other letters which came she said
less and less about Kendall. If they had been more experienced, they would
have been disturbed by this suspicious fact.
</p>
<p>
Then again, when Anson wrote asking &#34;What has become of that Kendall
you wrote so much about?&#34; she replied that he was there, and began
writing of him again in a careless sort of way, with the craft of woman
already manifest in the change of front.
</p>
<p>
Spring came again, and that ever-recurring miracle, the good green grass,
sprang forth from its covering of ice and snow, up from its hiding-place
in the dark, cold sod.
</p>
<p>
Again the two men set to work ferociously at the seeding. Up early in
the wide, sweet dawn, toiling through the day behind harrow and seeder,
coming in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_094" id="Page_094">94</a></span>
at noon to a poor and badly cooked meal, hurrying back to the field
and working till night, coming in at sundown so tired that one leg
could hardly be dragged by the other&mdash;this was their daily life.
</p>
<p>
One day, as they were eating their supper of sour bread and canned
beans, Gearheart irritatedly broke out: &#34;Ans, why don't you git
married? It 'u'd simplify matters a good 'eal if you should.
'Old Russ' is no good.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;What's the matter with <em>your</em> gittin' married?&#34; replied
Anson, imperturbably pinching off the cooked part of the loaf, skilfully
leaving the doughy part.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I ain't on the marry; that's all.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Neither am I.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, you ought to be.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Don't see it.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, now, let me show it. We can't go on this way. I'm gittin'
so poor you can count my ribs through my shirt. Jest think how
comfortable it would make things! No more awful coffee; no more
canned baked beans; no more cussed, infernal, everlastin', leathery
flapjacks; no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_095" id="Page_095">95</a></span>
more soggy bread&mdash;confound it!&#34; Here he seized the round
inner part of the loaf, from which the crust had been flaked, and
flung it through the open door far down toward the garden.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Bert! that's the last bit of bread we've got in the house.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;What's the odds? We couldn't eat it.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;We could 'a' baked it over.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;We <em>could</em> eat dog, but we don't,&#34; replied Bert gloomily.
His temper was getting frightful of late.
</p>
<p>
&#34;We'll be all right when Flaxen comes back,&#34; said Ans, laughing.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say, now, you've said that a thousand times this winter. You
know well enough Flaxen's out o' this. We ain't countin' on her,&#34;
blurted Gearheart, just in the mood to say disagreeable things.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wha' d' y' mean? Ain't she comin' back in June?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Probably; but she won't stay.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;No: that's so. She'll have to go back in September; but that's three
months, an' we may sell out by that time if we have a good crop.
Anyway, we'll live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_096" id="Page_096">96</a></span>
high fer a spell. We ought to have a letter from her to-night, hadn't we?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I'm goin' down to see, if you'll wash the dishes.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;All right. Take a horse.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;No: the horses are tired. I'll foot it.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, ain't you too?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Want anythin' from the store?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes: git a hunk o' bacon an' some canned corn, tomatoes, an' some
canned salmon; if y' think we can stand the pressure, bring home a can 
o' peaches.&#34;
</p>
<p>
And so Gearheart started off for town in the dusk, afoot, in order to spare
the horse, as though he had not himself walked all day long in the soft,
muddy ground. The wind was soft and moist, and the light of the stars
coming out in the east fell upon his upturned eyes with unspeakable majesty.
Yet he saw them but dimly. He was dreaming of a face which was often in his
mind now&mdash;a face not unlike Flaxen's, only older, more glorified, more
womanly. He was asking himself some searching questions to-night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_097" id="Page_097">97</a></span>
as his tired limbs dragged themselves over the grassy road.
</p>
<p>
What was he toiling for, anyway? What mattered all this terrible
tramping to and fro&mdash;was it an end or only a means? Would
there ever come anything like satisfaction of desire? Life for
him had been a silent, gloomy, and almost purposeless struggle.
He had not looked forward to anything very definite, though
vaguely he had hoped for something better.
</p>
<p>
As his eyes fell upon the twinkling, yellow lights of the village
his thoughts came back to Flaxen and to the letter which he
expected to receive from her. He quickened his steps, though his
feet were sore and his limbs stiff and lame.
</p>
<p>
The one little street presented its usual Saturday-night appearance.
Teams were hitched to the narrow plank walk before the battlemented
wooden stores. Men stood here and there in listless knots, smoking,
talking of the weather and of seeding, while their wives, surrounded
by shy children, traded within. Being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_098" id="Page_098">98</a></span>
Saturday night, the saloons were full of men, and shouts and the
clink of beer-mugs could be heard at intervals. But the larger
crowd was gathered at the post-office: uncouth farmers of all
nationalities, clerks, land-sharks, lawyers, and giggling girls
in couples, who took delight in mingling with the crowd.
</p>
<p>
Judge Sid Balser was over from Boomtown, and was talking expansively
to a crowd of &#34;leading citizens&#34; about a scheme to establish
a horse-car line between Boomtown and Belleplain.
</p>
<p>
Colonel Arran, of the Belleplain <i>Argus</i>, in another corner, not
ten feet away, was saying that the judge was &#34;a scoundrel, a
blow-hard, and would down his best lover for a pewter cent,&#34; to
all of which the placid judge was accustomed and gave no heed.
</p>
<p>
Bert paid no attention to the colonel or to the judge, or to any of this
buzzing. &#34;They are just talking to hear themselves make a noise,
anyway. They talk about building up the country&mdash;they who are a
rope and a grindstone around the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_099" id="Page_099">99</a></span>
necks of the rest of us, who do the work.&#34;
</p>
<p>
When Gearheart reached his box he found a large, square letter in it,
and looking at it saw that it was from Flaxen directed to Anson.
&#34;Her picture, probably,&#34; he said as he held it up. As he was
pushing rapidly out he heard a half-drunken fellow say, in what he
thought was an inaudible tone:
</p>
<p>
&#34;There's Gearheart. Wonder what's become of his little Norsk.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Gearheart turned, and pushing through the crowd, thrust his eyes
into the face of the speaker with a glare that paralysed the poor fool.
</p>
<p>
&#34;What's become o' your sense?&#34; he snarled, and his voice
had in it a carnivorous note.
</p>
<p>
With this warning he turned contemptuously and passed out, leaving
the discomfited rowdy to settle accounts with his friends. But
there was a low note in the ruffian's voice, an insinuating
inflection, which stayed with him all along the way home, like a
bad taste in the mouth. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
He saw by the aid of a number of these side-lights of late that Flaxen
never could come back to them in the old relation; but how could she 
come back?
</p>
<p>
Gearheart stopped and gazed thoughtfully upward. She must come back
as the wife of Ans or himself. &#34;Pooh! she is only a child,&#34;
he said, snapping his finger and walking on. But the insistence
remained. &#34;She is not a child&mdash;she is a maiden, soon to be
a woman; she has no relatives, no home to go to but ours after her
two or three years of schooling are over. It must still be her home;
no breath of scandal shall touch her if I can prevent it; and after
her two years are up&#34;&mdash;after a long, motionless reverie he
strode forward&mdash;&#34;she shall choose between us.&#34;
</p>
<p>
There had grown up between the two friends of late a constraint, or,
to be more exact, Gearheart had held himself in before his friend, 
had not discussed these problems with him at all. &#34;Ans is just
like a boy,&#34; he had said to himself; &#34;he don't seem to
understand the case, and I 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
don't know as it's my duty to enlighten him; he either feels very sure
about her, or he has not understood the situation.&#34;
</p>
<p>
He was thinking this now as he strode across the spongy sod toward the
lighted windows of the shanty. The air was damp and chill, for the ice
was not yet out of the ponds or swamps of tall grasses. An occasional
prairie-cock sent forth a muffled, drowsy &#34;boom&#34;; low-hung
flights of geese, gabbling anxiously, or the less-orderly ducks, with
hissing wings, swept by overhead, darkly limned against the stars.
There was a strange charm in the raw air. The weary man almost forgot
his pain as he drew deep breathings of the night.
</p>
<p>
It was significant of the restraint that had grown up between him and
Anson that he held the letter from Flaxen unopened in his hand simply
because it was directed to his friend. He knew that it was as much to
him as to Anson, and yet, feeling as he had of late, he would not open
it, for he would have been angry if Anson had opened one directed to 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
him. He simply judged Anson by himself.
</p>
<p>
The giant was asleep when he entered. His great, shaggy head lay beside
the lamp on his crossed arms. Bert laid the letter down beside him and 
shook him.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Hello! got back, hey?&#34; the sleeper said, rousing up sluggishly.
&#34;Anything?&#34; Then he caught sight of the letter. &#34;Oh, bless
her little heart! Wonder what it is? Picture, bet my hat!&#34; Here he
opened it.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Gee whittiker, thunder and turf, gosh-all&mdash;Friday!&mdash;look
a-there! Ain't she growed!&#34; he yelled, holding the picture by the
corner and moving it into all sorts of positions. &#34;That's my little
girl&mdash;our Flaxen; she can't grow so purty but what I'd know her.
See that hair done up on the top of her head! Look at that dress, an'
the thingumajigs around her neck! Oh, she's gittin' there, Smith, hey?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;She's changing pretty fast,&#34; said Bert listlessly.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Changin' fast! Say, ol' man, what's the matter with you? Are y' sick?&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
&#34;I'm played out, that's all.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Darn my skin! I should think y' would be, draggin' all day, an' then
walkin' all o' four mile to the post-office. Jest lay down on the bed
there, ol' boy, while I read the letter to yeh. Say, ol' man, don't you
git up in the mornin' till you please. I'll look after the breakfast,&#34; 
insisted Anson, struck with remorse by the expression on Bert's face.
&#34;But here's the letter. Short an' sweet.&#34;
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent no-space-bottom">
<span class="sc">
Dear Boys
</span>
[Bless the little fist that wrote that!]. I send my picture. I think it
is a nice one. The girls say it flatters me, but Will says it don't
[What the devil do we care what Will says?]&mdash;I guess it does,
don't you? I wish I had a picture of you both; I want to show the
girls how handsome you are [she means me, of course. No, confound it]
how handsome you are both of you. I wish you would send me your
pictures both of you. I ain't got much to say. I will write again 
soon.
</p>
<p class="no-space-top sig sc">
Elga.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bert looked at the picture over Anson's shoulder, but did not seem to
pay much attention to it.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
&#34;Wal, I'll go out an' shut the barn door. Nights git cold after the
sun goes down. You needn't peel the 'taters to-night. We'll bake 'em,
brussels an' all, to-morrow mornin'.&#34;
</p>
<p>
When Anson had gone, Bert snatched up the picture with great eagerness
and gazed upon it with a steady, devouring glance. How womanly she
looked with her hair done up so, and the broad, fair face and full
bosom.
</p>
<p>
He heard Anson returning from the barn, and hastily laid the picture
down, and when Anson entered was apparently dropping off to sleep.

<p class="head">
FLAXEN COMES HOME ON A VACATION.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
It was in June, just before the ending of the school, that Flaxen
first began to write about delaying her return. Anson was wofully
disappointed. He had said all along that she would make tracks
for home just as soon as school was out, and he had calculated
just when she would arrive; and on the second day after the close
of school for the summer he drove down to the train to meet her.
She did not come, but he got a letter which said that one of her
friends wanted her to stay two weeks with her, until after the 
Fourth of July.
</p>
<p>
&#34;She's an awful nice girl, and we will have a grand time; she
has a rich father and a piano and a pony and a buggy. It will just
be grand.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
&#34;I don't blame her none,&#34; sighed Anson to Bert. &#34;I don't
want her to come away while she's enjoyin' herself. It'll be a big
change for her to come back an' cook f'r us old mossbacks after
bein' at school an' in good company all these months.&#34;
</p>
<p>
He was plainly disturbed. Her vacation was going to be all too short
at the best, and he was so hungry for the sight of her! Still, he
could not blame her for staying, under the circumstances; as he told
Bert, his feelings did not count. He just wanted her to get all she
could out of life; &#34;there ain't much, anyway, for us poor devils,
but what little there is we want her to have.&#34;
</p>
<p>
The Fourth of July was the limit of her stay, and on the sixth,
seventh, and eighth Anson drove regularly to the evening train
to meet her.
</p>
<p>
On the third day another letter came, saying that she would reach
home the next Monday. With this Anson rode home in triumph. During
the next few days he went to the barber's and had his great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
beard shaved off. &#34;Made me look so old,&#34; he explained, seeing
Bert's wild start of surprise. &#34;I've be'n carryin' that mop o'
hair round so long I'd kind o' got into the notion o' bein' old
myself. Got a kind o' crick in the back, y' know. But I ain't;
I ain't ten years older'n you be.&#34;
</p>
<p>
And he was not. His long blond moustache, shaved beard, and clipped
hair made a new man of him, and a very handsome man, too, in a large
way. He was curiously embarrassed by Bert's prolonged scrutiny, and 
said jocosely:
</p>
<p>
&#34;We've got to brace up a little now. Company boarders comin', young
lady from St. Peter's Seminary, city airs an' all that sort o' thing.
Don't you let me see you eatin' pie with y'r knife. I'll break the
shins of any man that feeds himself with anythin' 'cept the
silver-plated forks I've bought.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Flaxen had been gone almost a year, and a year counts for much at her
age. Besides, Anson had exaggerated ideas of the amount of learning
she could absorb in a year at a boarding-seminary, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
he had also a very vague idea of what &#34;society&#34; was in St.
Peter, although he seemed suddenly to awake to the necessity of 
&#34;bracing up&#34; a little and getting things generally into
shape. He bought a new suit of clothes and a second-hand two-seated
carriage, notwithstanding the sarcastic reflection of his partner,
who was making his own silent comment upon this thing.
</p>
<p>
&#34;The paternal business is <i>auskerspeelt</i>,&#34; he said to
himself. &#34;Ans is goin' in on shape now. Well, it's all right;
nobody's business but ours. Let her go, Smith; but they won't be no
talk in this neighbourhood when they get hold of what's goin'
on&mdash;oh, no!&#34; He smiled grimly. &#34;We can stand it, I
guess; but it'll be hard on her. Ans is a little too previous.
It's too soon to spring this trap on the poor little thing.&#34;
</p>
<p>
They stood side by side on the platform the next Monday when the
train rolled into the station at Boomtown, panting with fatigue
from its long run. Flaxen caught sight of Bert first as she
sprang off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
the train, and running to him, kissed him without much embarrassment.
Then she looked around, saying:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Where's ol' pap? Didn't he&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Why, Flaxen, don't ye know me?&#34; he cried out at her elbow.
</p>
<p>
She knew his voice, but his shaven face, so much more youthful, was
so strange that she knew him only by his eyes laughing down into hers.
Nevertheless she kissed him doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, what've you done? You've shaved off your whiskers; you don't
look a bit natural. I&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
She was embarrassed, almost frightened, at the change in him. He 
&#34;looked so queer&#34;; his fair, untroubled, smiling face and
blond moustache made him look younger than Bert.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Nev' mind that! She'll grow again if y' like it better. Get int'
this new buggy&mdash;it's ours. They ain't no flies on us to-day; not
many,&#34; said Ans in high glee, elaborately assisting her to the
carriage, not appreciating the full meaning of the situation.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
As they rode home he was extravagantly gay. He sat beside her, and she
drove, wild with delight at the prairie, the wheat, the gulls, everything.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Ain't no dust on our clo'es,&#34; said Ans, coughing, winking at Bert,
and brushing off with an elaborately finical gesture an imaginary fleck
from his knee and elbow. &#34;Ain't we togged out? I guess nobody said
'boo' to us down to St. Peter, eh?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;You like my clo'es?&#34; said Flaxen, with charming directness.
</p>
<p>
&#34;You bet! They're scrumptious.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, they ought to be; they're my best, except my white dress.
I thought you'd like 'em; I wore 'em a-purpose.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Like 'em? They're&mdash;you're jest as purty as a red lily er a
wild rose in the wheat&mdash;ahem! Ain't she, Bert, ol' boy? We're
jest about starvin' to death, we are.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I knew you'd be. What'll I stir up for supper? Biscuits?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Um, um! Say, what y' s'pose I've got to go with 'em?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Honey.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, you're too sharp,&#34; wailed Ans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
while Flaxen went off into a peal of laughter. &#34;Say, Bert's be'n in
the <em>damnedest</em>&mdash;excuse me&mdash;plaguedest temper fer the
last two munce as you ever did see.&#34;
</p>
<p>
While this chatter was going on Bert sat silent and unsmiling on
the back seat. He was absorbed in seeing the exquisite colour that
played in her cheek and the equally charming curves of her figure.
She was well dressed and was wonderfully mature. He was saying to
himself: &#34;Ans ain't got no more judgment than a boy. We can't
keep that girl here. More'n that, the girl never'll be contented
again, unless&mdash;&#34; He did not allow himself to go farther. 
He dared not even think farther.
</p>
<p>
They had a merry time that night, quite like old times. The biscuits
were light and flaky, the honey was delightsome, and the milk and
butter (procured specially) were fresh. They shouted in laughter as
Flaxen insisted on their eating potatoes with a fork, and opposed
the use of the knife in scooping up the honey from their plates!
Even the saturnine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Bert forgot his gloom and laughed too, as Ans laboriously dipped his
honey with a fork, and, finally growing desperate, split a biscuit in
half, and in the good old boyish way sopped it in the honey.
</p>
<p>
&#34;There, that's the Christian way of doing things!&#34; he exulted,
while Flaxen laughed. How bright she was&mdash;how strange she acted!
There were moments when she embarrassed them by some new womanly grace
or accomplishment, some new air which she had caught from her
companions or teachers at school. It was truly amazing how much she
had absorbed outside of her regular studies. She indeed was no longer
a girl; she was a young woman, and to them a beautiful one.
</p>
<p>
Not a day passed without some added surprise which made Anson exult
and say, &#34;She's gettin' her money's worth down there&mdash;no
two ways about that.&#34;
</p>

<h2><a href="#contents">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>
</div>
<p class="head">
FLAXEN GROWS RESTLESS.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
But as the excitement of getting back died out, poor Flaxen grew
restless, moody, and unaccountable. Before, she had always been
the same cheery, frank, boyish creature. As Bert said, 
&#34;You know where to find her.&#34; Now she was full of strange
tempers and moods. She would work most furiously for a time, and
then suddenly fall dreaming, looking away out on the shimmering
plain toward the east.
</p>
<p>
At Bert's instigation, a middle-aged widow had been hired, at a
fabulous price, to come and do the most of the work for them,
thus releasing Flaxen from the weight of the hard work, which
perhaps was all the worse for her. Hard work might have prevented
the unbearable, sleepless pain within. She hated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the slatternly Mrs. Green at once for her meddling with her affairs,
though the good woman meant no offence. She was jocose in the broad
way of middle-aged persons, to whom a love-affair is legitimate
food for raillery.
</p>
<p>
But Gearheart's keen eye was on Flaxen as well. He saw how eagerly she
watched for the mail on Tuesdays and Fridays, and how she sought a
quiet place at once in order to read and dream over her letters.
She was restless a day or two before a certain letter came, with an
eager, excited, expectant air. Then, after reading it, she was
absent-minded, flighty in conversation, and at last listlessly uneasy,
moving slowly about from one thing to another, in a kind of restless
inability to take continued interest in anything.
</p>
<p>
All this, if it came to the attention of Anson at all, was laid to the
schooling the girl had had.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Of course it'll seem a little slow to you, Flaxie, but harvestin'
is comin' on soon, an' then things'll be a little more lively.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
But Gearheart was not so slow-witted. He had had sisters and girl
cousins, and knew &#34;the symptoms,&#34; as Mrs. Green would have
put it. He noticed that when Flaxen read her letters to them there
was one which she carefully omitted. He knew that this was the
letter which meant the most to her. He saw how those letters
affected her, and thought he had divined in what way.
</p>
<p>
One day when Flaxen, after reading her letters, sprang up and ran
into her bedroom, her eyes filled with sudden tears, Gearheart
crooked his finger at Ans, and they went out to the barn together.
</p>
<p>
It was nearly one o'clock on an intolerable day peculiar to the
Dakota plain. A frightfully hot, withering, and powerful wind was
abroad. The thermometer stood nearly a hundred in the shade, and
the wind, so far from being a relief, was suffocating because of
its heat and the dust it swept along with it.
</p>
<p>
The heavy-headed grain and russet grass writhed and swirled as if
in agony, and dashed high in waves of green and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
yellow. The corn-leaves had rolled up into long cords like the lashes
of a whip, and beat themselves into tatters on the dry, smooth spot
their blows had made beneath them; they seemed ready to turn to flame
in the pitiless, furnace-like blast. Everywhere in the air was a
silver-white, impalpable mist, which gave to the cloudless sky a
whitish cast. The glittering gulls were the only living things that
did not move listlessly and did not long for rain. They soared and
swooped, exulting in the sounding wind; now throwing themselves upon
it, like a swimmer, then darting upward with miraculous ease, to dip
again into the shining, hissing, tumultuous waves of the grass.
</p>
<p>
Along the roads prodigious trains of dust rose hundreds of feet in
the air, and drove like vast caravans with the wind. So powerful
was the blast that men hesitated about going out with carriages,
and everybody watched feverishly, expecting to see fire break
out on the prairie and sweep everything before it. Work in the
fields had stopped long before dinner, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the farmers waited, praying or cursing, for the wheat was just at
the right point to be blighted.
</p>
<p>
As the two men went out to the shed side by side, they looked out on
the withering wheat-stalks and corn-leaves with gloomy eyes.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Another day like this, an' they won't be wheat enough in this
whole county to make a cake,&#34; said Anson, with a calm intonation,
which after all betrayed the anxiety he felt. They sat down in the
wagon-shed near the horses' mangers. They listened to the roar of
the wind and the pleasant sound of the horses eating their hay, a
good while before either of them spoke again. Finally Bert said sullenly:
</p>
<p>
&#34;We can't put up hay such a day as this. You couldn't haul it home
under lock an' key while this infernal wind is blowin'. It's gittin'
worse, if anythin'.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Anson said nothing, but waited to hear what Bert had brought him out
here for. Bert speared away with his knife at a strip of board.
Anson sat on a wagon-tongue, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
his elbows on his knees, looking intently at the grave face of his
companion. The horses ground cheerily at the hay.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Ans, we've got to send Flaxen back to St. Peter; she's so homesick
she don't know what to do.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Ans' eyes fell.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I know it. I've be'n hopin' she'd git over that, but it's purty
tough on her, after bein' with the young folks in the city f'r a year,
to come back here on a farm.&#34; He did not finish for a moment.
&#34;But she can't stand it. I'd looked ahead to havin' her here till
September, but I can't stand it to see her cryin' like she did to-day.
We've got to give up the idee o' her livin' here. I don't see any other
way but to sell out an' go back East somewhere.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Bert saw that Anson was still ignorant of the real state of
affairs, but thought he would say nothing for the present.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes: that's the best thing we can do. We'll send her right back,
an' take our chances on the crops. We can git enough to live on an'
keep her at school, I guess.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
They sat silent for a long time, while the wind tore round the shed,
Bert spearing at the stick, and Anson watching the hens as they
vainly tried to navigate in the wind. Finally Anson spoke:
</p>
<p>
&#34;The fact is, Bert, this ain't no place f'r a woman, anyway&mdash;such
a woman as Flaxen's gittin' to be. They ain't nothin' goin' on, nothin'
to see 'r hear. You can't expect a girl to be contented with this
country after she's seen any other. No trees; no flowers; jest a lot o'
little shanties full o' flies.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I knew all that, Ans, a year ago. I knew she'd never come back here,
but I jest said it's the thing to do&mdash;give her a chance, if we don't
have a cent; now let's go back to the house an' tell her she needn't
stay here if she don't want to.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wha' d' ye s'pose was in that letter?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Couldn't say. Some girl's description of a pic-nic er somethin'.&#34;
Bert was not yet ready to tell what he knew. When they returned to the
house the girl was still invisible, in her room. Mrs. Green was busy
clearing up the dinner-dishes.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
&#34;I don't know's I ever see such a wind back to Michigan. Seems as if
it 'u'd blow the hair off y'r head.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, this ain't nothin'. This is a gentle zephyr. Wait till y' see
a wind.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Wal, I hope to goodness I won't never see a wind. Zephyrs is all
I can mortally stand.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Anson went through the little sitting-room and knocked on Flaxen's door.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Flaxie, we want to talk to yeh.&#34; There was no answer, and he
came back and sat down. Bert pointed to the letter which Flaxen had
flung down on the table. The giant took it, folded it up, and called,
&#34;Here's y'r letter, babe.&#34;
</p>
<p>
The door opened a little, and a faint, tearful voice said:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Read it, if ye want to, boys.&#34; Then the door closed tightly
again, and they heard her fling herself on the bed. Anson handed the
letter to Bert, who read it in a steady voice.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="no-space-bottom">
<span class="sc">
Dear Darling</span>: I have good news to tell you. My uncle was out
from Wisconsin to see me, and he was pleased with what I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
done, and he bought out Mr. Ford, and gave me the whole half interest.
I'm to pay him back when I please. Ain't that glorious? Now we can
get married right off, can't we, darling? So you just show this
letter to your father, and tell him how things stand. I've got a
good business. The drug store is worth $1,200 a year&mdash;my
half&mdash;but knock off fifty per cent and we could live nicely.
Don't you think so? I want to see you so bad, and talk things over.
If you can't come back soon, I will come on. Write soon.
</p>
<p class="no-space-top no-space-bottom sig sincerely-yours-pad">
Yours till death,
</p>
<p class="no-space-top sig sc">
Will.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
From the first word Anson winced, grew perplexed, then suffered. His
head drooped forward on his hands, his elbows rested on his vast,
spread knees. He drew his breath with a long, grieving gasp. Bert
read on steadily to the end, then glanced at his companion with a
deep frown darkening his face; but he was not taken by surprise.
He had not had paternal affection change to the passion of a lover
only to have it swept down like a half-opened flower. For the
first time in his life Anson writhed in mental agony. He saw it
all. It meant eternal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
separation. It meant a long ache in his heart which time could
scarcely deaden into a tolerable pain.
</p>
<p>
Gearheart rose and went out, unwilling to witness the agony of
his friend and desiring himself to be alone. Anson sat motionless,
with his hands covering his wet eyes, going over the past and
trying to figure the future.
</p>
<p>
He began in that storm: felt again the little form and face of the
wailing child; thought of the frightful struggle against the wind
and snow; of the touch of the little hands and feet; of her pretty
prattle and gleeful laughter; then of her helpful and oddly-womanish
ways as she grew older; of the fresh, clear voice calling him
&#34;pap&#34; and ordering him about with a roguish air; of her
beauty now, when for the first time he had begun to hope that she
might be something dearer to him.
</p>
<p>
How could he live without her? She had grown to be a part of him.
He had long ceased to think of the future without her. As he sat
so, the bedroom door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
opened, and Flaxen's tearful face looked out at him. He did not
seem to hear, and she stole up to him and, putting her arm around
his neck, laid her cheek on his head&mdash;a dear, familiar,
childish gesture, used when she wished to propitiate him. He
roused himself and put his arm about her waist, tried to speak, and
finally said in a sorry attempt at humor, wofully belied by the
tears on his face and the choking in his throat:
</p>
<p>
&#34;You tell that feller&mdash;if he wants ye, to jest come
an'&mdash;git ye&mdash;that's all!&#34;

<p class="head">
FLAXEN SAYS GOOD-BYE.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Elga went back to her friends, the Holts, in the course of a week.
It hurt Anson terribly to see how eager she was to get away, and
he grew a little bitter&mdash;a quality of temper Bert did not know
he possessed.
</p>
<p>
&#34;What's that little whipper-snapper ever done for her, that she
should leave us in the shade f'r him&mdash;f'rget us an' all we've
done f'r her, an' climb out an' leave us just at his wink? It beats
me, but it's all right. I don't blame her if she feels so&mdash;only
it does seem queer, now don't it?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;It does, that's a fact&mdash;'specially the idea of leaving us
for a thing like that.&#34;
</p>
<p>
After arriving at a complete understanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of the matter, they said no more about it, but went to work to make
everything as pleasant for Flaxen as possible. Again they rode down
to the station with her, down past the wide, level fields of grain
which the blazing sun had ripened prematurely. Again they parted from
her at the train, but this time the girl was eager to go; and yet a
peculiar feeling of sadness was mixed with her eagerness to be off.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Now, boys, you'll come down just as soon as you can this fall,
won't you?&#34; she said, tearfully, as they stood in the aisle of
the car. &#34;I wish't you'd sell out an' come back there an'
live&mdash;I want you to.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, we'll try,&#34; Anson said, speaking with difficulty, the
lump in his throat was so big and so dry.
</p>
<p>
They rode home in silence again, but this time there was something
darker and more sullen in their thoughts.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, Ans, that settles it. We're orphaned again, sure.&#34; He
tried to give a little touch of jocoseness to it, but failed miserably.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
&#34;Yes,&#34; Anson sighed deeply, &#34;we'll haf t' stand it, I s'pose,
but it's tough.&#34;
</p>
<p>
It was hard, but it would have been harder had not the rush and push of
the harvest come upon them just as it did. They never spoke of the matter
again, except as a matter settled, till they received a letter from the
young people asking their consent to an early marriage.
</p>
<p>
They both read the letter, and then Anson said, without raising his eyes:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, what d' you think of it?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, we might as well say yes,&#34; replied Bert irritably.
</p>
<p>
&#34;But she's so young.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;She seems so to us, but my mother was married at fifteen. If she's
going to leave us, why, the sooner she has a home the better, I s'pose.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I s'pose you're right. But I'd rather have 'em put it off a year.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, a year wouldn't make any difference, and besides, you can't
stop the thing now. She's out of our hands.&#34;
</p>
<p>
They wrote giving their consent, and the wedding was fixed for late
September
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to enable the fall's work to be put out of the way. For Elga's sake
they bought new suits and hats before starting on their trip, though
the harvest hardly justified any extravagance.
</p>
<p>
Under other circumstances they would have rejoiced over the trip,
for it was carrying them back to the gleam of leaf-dappled streams
and waving trees and deep, cool forests. It made their nostrils
dilate with pleasure as they whirled past fern-filled ravines, out
of which the rivulets stole with stealthy circuits under mossy rocks.
They were both forest-born, and it was like getting back home out of
a strange desert country to come back into &#34;the States.&#34;
</p>
<p>
St. Peter was a small town, situated on the steep bank of a broad
river&mdash;that is to say, the business street was there, but the
seminary and the residence part of the town was on a high and
beautiful plateau. The country was well diversified with wood and
prairie.
</p>
<p>
Kendall and Elga met them at the station. Elga with flushed face was searching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
the car-windows with eager glance, when Anson appeared on the
platform. The quick rush she made for him drove out all his
bitterness. It made him understand that she loved him as if
he were her father.
</p>
<p>
She greeted Bert with a little less warmth, and chattering with
joy she led the way up the street with Anson. She had a hundred
things to tell him, and he listened in a daze. She seemed so
different from his Flaxen. Bert walked behind with Kendall, who
did not impress him favourably.
</p>
<p>
He was a harmless little creature enough&mdash;small, a little
inclined to bow-legs, and dudish in manner and dress. His hair
was smoothed till it shone like ebony, and he wore the latest
designs in standing collars, high on his slim neck. His hands
were beautifully small and white and held several rings. He had
the manners of a dry-goods clerk.
</p>
<p>
&#34;He can't abuse her, that's one good thing about the whelp,&#34;
thought Bert as he crushed the young bridegroom's hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
in his brown palm, just to see him cringe.
</p>
<p>
As for Kendall, he was a little afraid of these big fellows, so
sullen and strong; and he tried his best to please them, chirping
away brightly upon all kinds of things, ending up by telling them
his business plans.
</p>
<p>
&#34;We're one o' the best cities on the river. Couldn't be a better
place fer a business stand, don't you see? And we're getting to the
front with our wholesale department (of course&mdash;ha! ha! my wife's
father ought to know how I'm getting on), so you're welcome to look
over my books. Our trade is a cash trade so far as our retail trade
goes, and we're mighty careful who gets tick from us on the wholesale
trade. We're developing a great business.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Bert and Anson made no replies to his chatter, and he pattered along
by Anson's side like a small boy, showing them the town and its beauties.
Anson inwardly despised the little man, but held it a sort of treason
to think so, and tried to look upon him kindly.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
The wedding took place in the house of the Holt family, and was
in charge of Miss Holt, Elga's teacher. Kendall's parents could
not be present, which was a great disappointment to Elga, but 
Will was secretly glad of it. His father was a very crusty and
brutal old fellow, and he would not have fitted in smoothly beside
Bert and Anson, who were as uncomfortable as men could well be.
Both wished to avoid it, but dared not object.
</p>
<p>
Anson stood bravely through the ceremony as the father of the bride,
and bore himself with his usual massive, rude dignity. But he inwardly
winced as he saw Elga, looking very stately and beautiful in her
bride's veil, towering half a head above the sleek-haired little
clerk. Not a few of the company smiled at the contrast, but she had no
other feeling than perfect love and happiness.
</p>
<p>
When the ceremony was over and Anson looked around for Bert, he was
gone. He couldn't stand the pressure of the crowd and the whispered
comments, and had slipped away early in the evening.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Among the presents which were laid on the table in the dining-room was
a long envelope addressed to Mrs. Will Kendall. It contained a deed for
a house and lot in one of the most desirable parts of the suburbs.
It was from Gearheart, but there was no other written word. This gift
meant the sale of his claim in Dakota.
</p>
<p>
When Anson got back to the hotel that night, wondering and alarmed at
his partner's absence, he found a letter from him. It was savage and 
hopeless.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This climate is getting too frigid for my lungs. I'm going to emigrate
to California. I made a mistake: I ought to have gone in for stand-up
collars, shiny hair, and bow-legs. You'd better skip back to Dakota
and sell your claim. Keep my share of the stock and tools; it ain't
worth bothering about. Don't try to live there alone, old man. If you 
can't sell, marry. Don't let that girl break you all up too. We are all
fools, but some can get over it quicker than others.
</p>
<p>
If that little bow-legged thing gets under your feet or abuses her,
jest get your toe under him and hoist him over into the alley.
</p>
<p class="no-space-bottom">
Good-bye and good luck, old man.
</p>
<p class="no-space-top sig sc">
Bert.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
And the next day the doubly bereaved man started on his lonely
journey back to the Dakota claim, back to an empty house, with
a gnawing pain in his heart and a constriction like an iron band
about his throat; back to his broad fields to plod to and fro alone.
</p>
<p>
As he began to realize it all and to think how terrible was this
loss, he laid his head down on the car-seat before him and cried.
His first great trial had come to him, and meeting it like a man,
he must now weep like a woman.

</div>
<p class="head">
FLAXEN'S GREAT NEED.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Flaxen wrote occasionally, during the next year, letters all too
short and too far between for the lonely man toiling away on his
brown farm. These letters were very much alike, telling mainly of
how happy she was, and of what she was going to do by and by, on
Christmas or Thanksgiving. Once she sent a photograph of herself
and husband, and Anson, after studying it for a long time, took a
pair of shears and cut the husband off, and threw him into the fire.
</p>
<p>
&#34;That fellow gives me the ague,&#34; he muttered.
</p>
<p>
Bert did not write, and there was hardly a night that Ans lay down on
his bed that he did not wonder where his chum was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
especially as the winter came on unusually severe, reminding him of
that first winter in the Territory. Day after day he spent alone in
his house, going out only to feed the cattle or to get the mail. The
sad wind was always in his ears. But with the passage of time the
pain in his heart lost its intensity.
</p>
<p>
One day he got a letter from Flaxen that startled and puzzled him.
It was like a cry for help, somehow.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Dear old pap, I wish you was here,&#34; and then in another place
came the piteous cry, &#34;Oh, I wish I had some folks!&#34;
</p>
<p>
All night long that cry rang in the man's head with a wailing, falling
cadence like the note of a lost little prairie-chicken.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I wonder what that whelp has been doin' now. If he's begun to
abuse her I'll wring his neck. She wants me an' da'sn't ask me to
come. Poor chick, I'll be pap an' mam to ye, both,&#34; he said at
last, with sudden resolution.
</p>
<p>
The day after the receipt of this letter a telegram was handed to him
at the post-office,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
which he opened with trembling hands:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class=" no-space-bottom">
<span class="sc">
Anson Wood</span>: Your daughter is ill. Wants you. Come at once.
</p>
<p class="no-space-top sig sc">
Dr. Dietrich.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He got into his wagon mechanically and lashed his horses into a run.
He must get home and arrange about his stock and catch the seven
o'clock train. His mind ran the round of the possibilities in the
case until it ached with the hopeless fatigue of it. When he got
upon the train for an all-night ride, he looked like a man suffering
some great physical pain.
</p>
<p>
He sat there all night in a common seat&mdash;he could not afford to
pay for a sleeper; sat and suffered the honest torture that can come
to a man&mdash;to sit and think the same dread, apprehensive wondering
thoughts; to strain at the seat as if to push the train faster, and to
ache with the desire to fly like the eagle. He tried to be patient,
but he could only grow numb with the effort.
</p>
<p>
A glorious winter sun was beginning to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
light up the frost foliage of the maples lining St. Peter's streets
when Anson, stiff with cold and haggard with a night of sleepless
riding, sprang off the train and looked about him. The beauty of
the morning made itself felt even through his care. These rows of
resplendent maples, heavy with iridescent frost, were like
fairy-land to him, fresh from the treeless prairie. As he walked on
under them, showers of powdered rubies and diamonds fell down upon
him; the colonnades seemed like those leading to some enchanted
palace, such as he had read of in boyhood. Every shrub in the
yards was similarly decked, and the snug cottages were like the
little house which he had once seen at the foot of the Christmas-tree
in a German church years before.
</p>
<p>
Feet crunched along cheerily on the sidewalks, bells of dray-teams
were beginning to sound, and workmen to whistle.
</p>
<p>
Anson was met at the door by a hard-faced, middle-aged woman.
</p>
<p>
&#34;How's my girl?&#34; he asked.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, she's nicely. Walk in.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
&#34;Can I see her now?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;She's sleepin'; I guess you better wait a little while till
after breakfast.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Where's Kendall?&#34; was his next question.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I d'n' know. Hain't seen 'im sence yesterday. He don't amount
to much, anyway, and in these cases there ain't no dependin' on a
boy like that. It's nachel fer girls to call on their mothers an'
fathers in such cases.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Anson was about to ask her what the trouble was with his girl, when
she turned away. She could not be dangerously ill; anyway, there was
comfort in that.
</p>
<p>
After he had eaten a slight breakfast of bad coffee and yellow biscuits,
Mrs. Stickney came back.
</p>
<p>
&#34;She's awake an' wants to see yeh. Now don't get excited. She
ain't dangerous.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Anson was alarmed and puzzled at her manner. Her smile mystified him.
</p>
<p>
&#34;What is the matter?&#34; he demanded.
</p>
<p>
Her reply was common enough, but it stopped him with his foot on
the threshold. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
He understood at last. The majesty and mystery of birth was like a light
in his face, and dazzled him. He was awed and exalted at the same time.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Open the door; I want to see her,&#34; he said in a new tone.
</p>
<p>
As they entered the darkened chamber he heard his girl's eager cry.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Is that you, pap?&#34; wailed her faint, sweet voice.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes: it's me, Flaxie.&#34; He crossed the room and knelt by
the bed. She flung her arms round his neck.
</p>
<p>
&#34;O pappy! pappy! I wanted you. Oh, my poor mamma! O pap, I don't
like her,&#34; she whispered, indicating the nurse with her eyes.
&#34;O pap, I hate to think of mother lying there in the snow&mdash;an'
Bert&mdash;where is Bert, pap? Perhaps he's in the blizzard too&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;She's a little flighty,&#34; said the nurse in her matter-of-fact tone.
</p>
<p>
Anson groaned as he patted the pale cheek of the sufferer.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Don't worry, Flaxie; Bert's all right. He'll come home soon.
Why don't you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
send for the doctor?&#34; he said to the nurse.
</p>
<p>
&#34;He'll be here soon. Don't worry over that,&#34; indicating
Flaxen, who was whispering to herself. &#34;They of'n do that.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Do you s'pose I can find my folks if I go back to Norway?&#34;
she said to Anson a little after.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes: I guess so, little one. When you get well, we'll try an'
see.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Perhaps if I found my aunt she'd look like mamma, an' I'd know then
how mamma looked, wouldn't I? Perhaps if the wheat is good this year we
can go back an' find her, can't we?&#34; Then her words melted into a
moan of physical pain, and the nurse said:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Now I guess you'd better go an' see if you can't hurry the doctor up.
Yes: now he's got to go,&#34; she went on to Flaxen, drowning out her
voice and putting her imploring hands back upon the bed.
</p>
<p>
Anson saw it all now. In her fear and pain she had turned to him&mdash;poor,
motherless little bird&mdash;forgetting her boy-husband or feeling the need
of a broader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
breast and stronger hand. It was a beautiful trust, and as the great,
shaggy man went out into the morning he was exalted by the thought.
&#34;My little babe&mdash;my Flaxen!&#34; he said with unutterable love 
and pity.
</p>
<p>
Again his mind ran over the line of his life&mdash;the cabin, the dead
woman, the baby face nestling at his throat, the girl coming to him
with her trials and triumphs. His heart swelled so that he could not
have spoken, but deep in his throat he muttered a dumb prayer. And how
he suffered that day, hearing her babble mixed with moanings every
time the door opened. Once the doctor said:
</p>
<p>
&#34;It's no use for you to stand here, Wood. It only makes you suffer
and don't help her a particle.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;It <em>seems</em> 's if it helped her, an' so&mdash;I guess I'll
stay. She may call for me, an' if she does,&#34; he said resolutely,
&#34;I'm goin' in, doctor. How is she now?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;She's slightly delirious now, but still she knows you're here.
She now and then speaks of you, but doesn't call for you.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
But she did call for him, and he went in, and kneeling by her side he
talked to her and held her hands, stroked her hair and soothed her as
he used to when a little child unable to speak save in her pretty
Norseland tongue, and at last when opiates were given, and he rose and
staggered from the room, it seemed as though he had lived years.
</p>
<p>
So weary was he that, when the doctor came out and said, &#34;You may
go to sleep now,&#34; he dropped heavily on a lounge and fell asleep
almost with the motion. Even the preparations for breakfast made by
the hoarse-voiced servant-girl did not wake him, but the drawling,
nasal tone of Kendall did. He sat up and looked at the oily little
clerk. It was after seven o'clock.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Hello!&#34; said Kendall, &#34;when d' you get in?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Shortly after you went out,&#34; said Anson in reply.
</p>
<p>
Kendall felt the rebuke, and as he twisted his cuffs into place said,
&#34;Well, y' see I couldn't do no good&mdash;a man ain't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
any good in such cases, anyway&mdash;so I just thought I'd run down
to St. Paul an' do a little buying.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Anson turned away and went into the kitchen to wash his face and to
comb his hair, glad to get rid of the sight of Kendall for a moment.
Mrs. Stickney was toasting some bread.
</p>
<p>
&#34;She's awake an' wants to see you when you woke up. It's a
girl&mdash;thought I'd tell ye&mdash;yes: she's comfortable. Say,
'tween you an' me, a man 'at 'u'd run off&mdash;waal&mdash;&#34;
she ended, expressively glancing at Kendall.
</p>
<p>
Once more Anson caught his breath as he entered the darkened chamber.
He was a rough, untaught man, but there was something in him that
made that room holy and mysterious. But the figure on the bed was
tranquil now, and the voice, though weak and low, was Flaxen's own.
</p>
<p>
He stopped as his eyes fell on her. She was no longer a girl. The
majesty of maternity was on her pale face and in her great eyes. 
A faint, expectant smile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
was on her lips; her eyes were fixed on his face as she drew the cover
from the little red, weirdly-wrinkled face at her throat.
</p>
<p>
Before he could speak, and while he was looking down at the mite of
humanity, Kendall stepped into the room.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Hello, Ellie! How are&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
A singular revulsion came out on her face. She turned to Anson.
&#34;Make him go 'way; I don't want him.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;All right,&#34; said Kendall cheerfully, glad to escape.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Isn't she beautiful?&#34; the mother whispered. &#34;Does she
look like me?&#34; she asked artlessly.
</p>
<p>
&#34;She's beautiful to me because she's yours, Flaxie,&#34; replied
Anson, with a delicacy all the more striking because of the contrast
with his great frame and hard, rough hands. &#34;But there, my girl,
go to sleep like baby, an' don't worry any more.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;You ain't goin' away while I'm sick?&#34; she asked, following
him with her eyes, unnaturally large.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
&#34;I won't never go 'way again if you don't want me to,&#34;
he replied.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, I'm so glad!&#34; she sighed restfully.
</p>
<p>
He was turning to go when she wailed reproachfully, 
&#34;Pap, you didn't kiss baby!&#34;
</p>
<p>
Anson turned and came back. &#34;She's sleepin', an'
I thought it wasn't right to kiss a girl without she
said so.&#34;
</p>
<p>
This made Flaxen smile, and Anson went out with a lighter
heart than he had had for two years. Kendall met him
utside and said confidentially:
</p>
<p>
&#34;I don't s'pose it was just the thing for me to do;
but&mdash;confound it! I never could stand a sick-room,
anyway. I couldn't do any good, anyway&mdash;just been
in the way. She'll get over her mad in a few days.
Think so?&#34;
</p>
<p>
But she did not. Her singular and sudden dislike of him continued,
and though she passively submitted to his being in the room, she
would not speak a word to him nor look at him as long as she could
avoid it; and when he approached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
the baby or took it in his arms a jealous frown came on her face.
</p>
<p>
As for Anson, he grew to hate the sound of that little chuckle
of Kendall's; the part in the man's hair and the hang of his
cut-away coat made him angry. The trim legs, a little bowed,
the big cuffs hiding the small, cold hands, and the peculiar
set of his faultless collar, grew daily more insupportable.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say, looky here, Kendall,&#34; said he in desperation one
day, &#34;I wish you didn't like me quite so well. We don't
hitch first rate&mdash;at least, I don't. Seems to me you're
neglectin' your business too much.&#34;
</p>
<p>
He was going to tell him to keep away, but he relented as he
looked down at the harmless little man, with his thin, boyish face.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Oh, my business is all right. Gregory looks after it mostly,
anyhow. But, I say, if you wanted to go into the dray business,
there's a first-class opening now. Clark wants to sell.&#34;
</p>
<p>
It ended in Anson seeing Clark and buying out his line of drays,
turning in 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
his claim toward the payment&mdash;a transaction which made
Flaxen laugh for joy, for she had not felt certain before
that he would remain in St. Peter. She was getting about the
house now, looking very wifely in her long, warm wraps, her
slow motions contrasting strongly with the old restless,
springing steps Anson remembered so well.
</p>
<p>
Night after night, as he sat beside the fire and held baby,
listening to the changed voice of his girl and watching the
grave, new expressions of her face, the tooth of time took
hold upon him powerfully, and he would feel his shaggy head
and think, &#34;I'll soon be gray, soon be gray!&#34; while
the little one cooed, and sprang, and pulled at his beard,
which had grown long again and had white hairs in it.
</p>
<p>
Kendall spent most of his time at the store, or downtown somewhere,
and so all of those long, delicious winter evenings were Flaxen's
and Anson's. And his enjoyment of them was pathetic. The cheerful
little sitting-room, the open 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
grate, the gracious, ever-growing womanliness of Elga, the pressure
of soft little limbs, and the babble of a liquid baby language, were
like the charm of an unexpected Indian-summer day between two gray
November storms.

<p class="head">
KENDALL STEPS OUT.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
One night Kendall did not come home, but as he had been talking of
going to St. Paul they were not disturbed about it&mdash;in fact,
they both took but very mild interest in his coming or going. In
the morning, while they were at breakfast, there came a knock at the door.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Come in,&#34; shouted Anson in the Western way, not rising.
</p>
<p>
McDaniel, the county sheriff, entered.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Where's Kendall?&#34; he asked without ceremony.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I don't know; went away yesterday.&#34;
</p>
<p>
The sheriff looked at his companion. &#34;Skipped between two days.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;What's up?&#34; asked Anson, while Elga
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
stared and baby reached slyly for the sugar-bowl.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Nothing,&#34; the sheriff said in a tone which meant everything.
&#34;Come out here,&#34; he said to Anson. Anson went out with him,
and he told him that Kendall had purchased goods on credit and
gambled the money away, and was ruined.
</p>
<p>
His stock of goods was seized, and the house was saved only through
the firmness of Anson.
</p>
<p>
Flaxen shut her lips and said nothing, and he could not read her
silence. One day she came to him with a letter.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Read that!&#34; she exclaimed scornfully. He saw that it was
dated from Eau Claire, Wisconsin:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="no-space-bottom noindent">
<span class="sc">
Dear Darling Wife</span>: I'm all right here with father. It was
all Gregory's fault&mdash;he was always betting on something.
I'm coming back as soon as the old man can raise the money to pay
Fitch. Don't worry about me. They can't take the house, anyway.
You might rent the house, sell the furniture on the sly, and come
back here. The old man will give me another show. I don't owe more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
than a thousand dollars, anyway. Write soon. Your loving
</p>
<p class="no-space-top sig sc">
Will.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
She did not need to say what she thought of the advice the little villain gave.
</p>
<p>
Anson went quietly on with his work, making a living for himself and
Flaxen and baby. It never occurred to either of them that any other
arrangement was necessary. Kendall wrote once or twice a month for
a while, saying each time, &#34;I'll come back and settle up,&#34;
and asking her to come to him; but she did not reply, and never
referred to him outside her home, and when others inquired after him
she replied evasively:
</p>
<p>
&#34;He's in Wisconsin somewhere; I don't know where.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Is he coming back?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I don't know.&#34;
</p>
<p>
She often spoke of Bert, and complained of his silence. Once she said:
</p>
<p>
&#34;I guess he's forgot us, pap.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I guess not. More likely he's thinkin' we've fergot him.
He'll turn up some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
bright mornin' with a pocketful o' rocks. He ain't no spring chicken,
Bert ain't.&#34; (&#34;All the same, I wish't he'd write,&#34; Anson
said to himself.)
</p>
<hr class="break" />
<p>
The sad death of Kendall came to them without much disturbing force.
He had been out of their lives so long that when Anson came in with
the paper and letter telling of the accident, and with his instinctive
delicacy left her alone to read the news, Flaxen was awed and saddened,
but had little sense of personal pain and loss.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Young Kendall,&#34; the newspaper went on under its scare-heads,
&#34;was on a visit to La Crosse, and while skating with a party on
the bayou, where the La Crosse River empties into the Father of Waters,
skated into an air-hole. The two young ladies with him were rescued,
but the fated man was swept under the ice. He was the son,&#34; etc.
</p>
<p>
When Anson came back Flaxen sat with the letter in her hand and the
paper on her lap. She was meditating deeply, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
what was in her mind Anson never knew. She had grown more and more
reticent of late. She sighed, rose, and resumed her evening tasks.

<p class="head">
BERT COMES BACK.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
One raw March evening, when the wind was roaring among the gray
branches of the maples like a lion in wrath, some one knocked
on the door.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Come in!&#34; shouted Anson, who was giving baby her regular
ride on his boots.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Come in!&#34; added Flaxen.
</p>
<p>
Gearheart walked in slowly, closed the door behind his back,
and stood devouring the cheerful scene. He was poorly dressed
and wore a wide, limp hat; they did not know him till he bared
his head.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Bert!&#34; yelled Anson, tossing the baby to his shoulder
and leaping toward his chum, tramping and shaking and clapping
like a madman, scaring the child.
</p>
<p>
&#34;My gosh-all-hemlock! I'm glad to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
see ye! Gimme that paw again. Come to the fire. This is Flaxie&#34;
(as though he had not had his eyes on her face all the time).
&#34;Be'n sick?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Bert's hollow cough prompted this question.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Yes. Had some kind of a fever down in Arizony. Oh, I'm all right
now,&#34; he added in reply to an anxious look from Flaxen.
</p>
<p>
&#34;An' this is&mdash;&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Baby&mdash;Elsie,&#34; she replied, putting a finishing touch
to the little one's dress, mother-like.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Where's he?&#34; he asked a little later.
</p>
<p>
Anson replied with a little gesture, which silenced Bert at the same
time that it explained. And when Flaxen was busy a few moments later,
Anson said:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Gone up the spout.&#34;
</p>
<p>
At the table they grew quite gay, talking over old times, and Bert's
pale face grew rosier, catching a reflection of the happy faces opposite.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say, Bert, do you remember the time you threw that pan o'
biscuits I made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
out into the grass an' killed every dog in the township?&#34;
Then they roared.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I remember your flapjacks that always split open in the middle,
an' no amount o' heat could cook 'em inside,&#34; Bert replied.
</p>
<p>
Then they grew sober again when Bert said with a pensive cadence:
&#34;Well, I tell you, those were days of hard work; but many's
the time I've looked back at 'em these last three years, wishin'
they'd never ended an' that we'd never got scattered.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;We won't be again, will we, pap?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Not if I can help it,&#34; Anson replied.
</p>
<p>
&#34;But how are you, Bert? Rich?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Bert put his hand into his pocket and laid a handful of small coins on the table.
</p>
<p>
&#34;That's the size o' my pile&mdash;four dollars,&#34; he said,
smiling faintly; &#34;the whole o' my three years' work.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Well, never mind, ol' man. I've got a chance fer yeh.
Still an ol' bach?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Still an old bach.&#34; He looked at Flaxen, irresistibly
drawn to her face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
She dropped her eyes; she could not have told why.
</p>
<p>
And so &#34;Wood &#38; Gearheart&#34; was painted on the sides of
the drays, and they all continued to live in the little yellow
cottage, enjoying life much more than the men, at least, had ever
dared to hope; and little Elsie grew to be a &#34;great girl,&#34;
and a nuisance with her desire to &#34;yide&#34; with &#34;g'an'pap.&#34;
</p>
<p>
There is no spot more delightful in early April than the sunny side
of the barn, and Ans and Bert felt this, though they did not say it.
The eaves were dripping, the doves cooing, the hens singing their
harsh-throated, weirdly suggestive songs, and the thrilling warmth
and vitality of the sun and wind of spring made the great, rude
fellows shudder with a strange delight. Anson held out his palm to
catch the sunshine in it, took off his hat to feel the wind, and mused:
</p>
<p>
&#34;This is a great world&mdash;and a great day. I wish't it was
always spring.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say,&#34; began Bert abruptly, &#34;it seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
pretty well understood that you're her father&mdash;but where do I come in?&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;You ought to be her husband.&#34; A light leaped into the younger
man's face. &#34;But go slow,&#34; Anson went on gravely. &#34;This
package is marked 'Glass; handle with care.'&#34;

"The established authorities in art and literature retain their
exclusive place in dictionaries and hand-books long after the claim
of their juniors to be observed with attention has been practically
conceded at home. For this reason, partly, and partly also because
the mental life of Holland receives little attention in this country, 
no account has yet been taken of the revolution in Dutch taste which
has occupied the last six or seven yean. I believe that the present
occasion is the first on which it has been brought to the notice of

catastrophe. Two or three new animal fables are introduced with effect; 
but the history of the plantation, the printing-office, the black 
runaways, and white deserters, of whom the impending break-up made 
the community tolerant, the coon and fox hunting, forms the serious

<p> 
"The idea of preserving and publishing these legends, in the form in 
which the old plantation negroes actually tell them, is altogether one of the 
happiest literary conceptions of the day. And very admirably is the work 
done.&hellip; In such touches lies the charm of this fascinating little
volume of legends, which deserves to be placed on a level with <i>Reincke
Fuchs</i> for its quaint humor, without reference to the ethnological
interest possessed by these stories, as indicating, perhaps, a common
origin for very widely severed races."&mdash;<i>London Spectator</i>. 
</p>
<p> 
"We are just discovering what admirable literary material there is at 
home, what a great mine there is to explore, and how quaint and peculiar 
is the material which can be dug up. Mr. Harris's book may be looked on 
in a double light&mdash;either as a pleasant volume recounting the
stories told by a typical old colored man to a child, or as a valuable
contribution to our somewhat meager folk-lore.&hellip; To Northern
readers the story of Brer (Brother&mdash;Brudder) Rabbit may be novel. To
those familiar with plantation life, who have listened to these quaint
old stories, who have still tender reminiscences of some good old mauma
who told these wondrous adventures to them when they were children,
Brer Rabbit, the Tar Baby, and Brer Fox come back again with all the
past pleasures of younger days."&mdash;<i>New York Times</i>.

letters from Thomas Carlyle, also letters from Mrs. 
Carlyle, to a personal friend. With Portrait. 
12mo. Cloth, gilt top, $1.75.
</p>
<p> 
"The interest of 'Wotton Reinfred' to me is considerable, from the 
sketches which it contains of particular men and women, most of whom
I knew and could, if necessary, identify. The story, too, is taken
generally from real life, and perhaps Carlyle did not finish it, from
the sense that it could not be published while the persons and things
could be recognized. That objection to the publication no longer exists.
Eveybody is dead whose likenesses have been drawn, and the incidents
stated have long been 
forgotten."&mdash;<span class="sc">James Anthony Froude</span>. 
</p>
<p> 
"'Wotton Reinfred' is interesting as a historical document. It gives 
Carlyle before he had adopted his peculiar manner, and yet there are some 
characteristic bits&mdash;especially at the beginning&mdash;in the Sartor 
Resartus vein. I take it that these are reminiscences of Irving and of the 
Thackeray circle, and there is a curious portrait of Coleridge, not very 
thinly veiled.  There is enough autobiography, too, of interest in its
way."&mdash;<span class="sc">Leslie Stephen</span>.

"The subject-matter of the book is of unsurpassed interest to all who 
either travel in new countries, to see for themselves the new

"A lucid sketch, at once popular and learned, of daily life in Egypt in 
the time of Rameses II, and of Assyria in that of Assurbanipal.&hellip; 
As an Orientalist, M. Masp&eacute;ro stands in the front rank, and his learning

reader."&mdash;<i>London Times</i>.

<p>  
"Only a writer who had distinguished himself as a student of Egyptian

furnishes views of the kings and queens concerned far fuller and more

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works to
protect the <span class="sc">Project Gutenberg</span>&trade;
concept and trademark.  Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission.  If you do not charge anything for copies of
this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy.  You may use this
eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works,
reports, performances and research.  They may be modified and printed
and given away&mdash;you may do practically <em>anything</em> with

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works</p>

<p>
1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>
1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>
1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade; works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg&trade; License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>
1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg&trade; work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>
1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>
1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg&trade; License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>
This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net.</p>

<p>
1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>
1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg &trade; License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; License.</p>

<p>
1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg&trade; web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>

<ul>
<li> You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg&trade; works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>
<li> You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg &trade; works.</li>
<li> You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>
<li> You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade; works.</li>
</ul>

<p>
1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>
1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg&trade;
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>
1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES: Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  <i>You agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those
provided in Paragraph F3.  You agree that the Foundation, the
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage. </i>
</p>

<p>
1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND: If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>
1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', <em>with no other
warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to
warranties of merchantibility or fitness for any purpose.</em>
</p>

<p>
1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>
1.F.6.  INDEMNITY: You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg&trade;
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>
<br />
<p class="bold">
Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;</p>

<p>
Project Gutenberg &trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg's&trade;
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.</p>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>

<p>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<em>send donations</em> or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org.</p>

<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate.</p>

<p class="bold">
Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.</p>

<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg&trade;
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>
